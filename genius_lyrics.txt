Song title is  Memories,
Here's to the ones that we got,
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not,
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories,
Of everything we've been through,
Toast to the ones here today,
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way,
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories,
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you,
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain,
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same,
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name,
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah,
Everybody hurts sometimes,
Everybody hurts someday, ayy ayy,
But everything gon' be alright,
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy,
Here's to the ones that we got,
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not,
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories,
Of everything we've been through,
Toast to the ones here today,

And the memories bring back, memories bring back you,
Doo doo, doo doo doo doo,

When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (ooh, yeah),
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark,
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah,
Everybody hurts sometimes,
Everybody hurts someday, ayy ayy,
But everything gon' be alright,
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy,
Here's to the ones that we got (oh),

Song title is  She will be loved
Beauty queen of only eighteen,
She had some trouble with herself,
He was always there to help her,
She always belonged to someone else,
I drove for miles and miles,
And wound up at your door,
I've had you so many times,
But somehow I want more,
I don't mind spendin' everyday,
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain,
Look for the girl with the broken smile,
Ask her if she wants to stay a while,
And she will be loved,
And she will be loved,
Tap on my window, knock on my door,
I want to make you feel beautiful,
I know I tend to get so insecure,
Doesn't matter anymore,
It's not always rainbows and butterflies,
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah,
My heart is full, and my door's always open,
You come anytime you want, yeah,
I don't mind spendin' everyday,
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain,
Look for the girl with the broken smile,
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile,
And she will be loved,
And she will be loved,
And she will be loved,
And she will be loved,
I know where you hide alone in your car,
Know all of the things that make you who you are,
I know that goodbye means nothing at all,
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls,
Yeah,
Tap on my window, knock on my door,
I want to make you feel beautiful,
I don't mind spendin' everyday,
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain, oh,
Look for the girl with the broken smile,
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile,
And she will be loved,
And she will be loved,
And she will be loved,
And she will be loved,
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye,
I don't mind spendin' everyday,
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain,
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye.


Song title is  Payphone,
I'm at a payphone trying to call home,
All of my change I spent on you,
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong,
Where are the plans we made for two,
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember,
The people we used to be,
It's even harder to picture,
That you're not here next to me,
You say it's too late to make it,
But is it too late to try,
And in our time that you wasted,
All of our bridges burned down,
I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights,
Now I'm paralyzed,
Still stuck in that time,
When we called it love,
But even the sun sets in paradise,
I'm at a payphone trying to call home,
All of my change I spent on you,
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong,
Where are the plans we made for two,
If Happy Ever Afters did exist,
I would still be holding you like this,
All those fairy tales are full of it,
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick,
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow,
'Cause you forgot yesterday,
I gave you my love to borrow,
But you just gave it away,
You can't expect me to be fine,
I don't expect you to care,
I know I've said it before,
But all of our bridges burned down,
I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights,
Now I'm paralyzed,
Still stuck in that time,
When we called it love,
But even the sun sets in paradise,
I'm at a payphone trying to call home,
All of my change I spent on you,
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong,
Where are the plans we made for two?,
If Happy Ever Afters did exist,
I would still be holding you like this,
All those fairy tales are full of it,
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick,
Now I'm at a payphone,
Man, F that sh--,
I'll be out spending all this money,
While you're sitting round wondering,
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,
Made it from the bottom,
Now when you see me I'm stunting,
And all of my cars start with a push of a button,
Telling me the chances I blew up,
Or whatever you call it,
Switch the number to my phone,
So you never could call it,
Don't need my name on my show,
You can tell it I'm ballin',
Swish, what a shame could have got picked,
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot,
So you talk about who you see at the top,
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for,
Phantom pulled up valet open doors,
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for,
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take,
That little piece of shit with you,
I'm at a payphone trying to call home,
All of my change I spent on you,
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong,
Where are the plans we made for two,
If Happy Ever Afters did exist,
I would still be holding you like this,
All those fairy tales are full of it,
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick,
Now I'm at a payphone.

Just shoot for the stars if it feels right,
And aim for my heart if you feel like it,
Take me away and make it okay,

Wherever you want get inside it,
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear,

Song title is  One more night
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh,
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war,
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door,
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we start keeping score,
You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can't do this no more,
But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you,
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go,
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo,
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you,
So I cross my heart and I hope to die,
That I'll only stay with you one more night,
And I know I said it a million times,
But I'll only stay with you one more night,
Try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yes,
Try to tell you stop but your lipstick got me so out of breath,
I'll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself,
And I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell,
But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you,
And I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go,
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo,
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you,
So I cross my heart and I hope to die,
That I'll only stay with you one more night,
And I know I said it a million times,
But I'll only stay with you one more night,
Yeah baby give me one more night,
Yeah baby give me one more night,
Yeah baby give me one more night,
Baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you,
And I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go,

And I know I said it a million times,
But I'll only stay with you one more night,

So I cross my heart and I hope to die,
That I'll only stay with you one more night,
And I know I said it a million times,
But I'll only stay with you one more night.

Song title is  Maps,
I miss the taste of a sweeter life,
I miss the conversation,
I'm searching for a song tonight,
I'm changing all of the stations,
I like to think that we had it all,
We drew a map to a better place,
But on that road I took a fall,
Oh baby why did you run away?,
I was there for you,
In your darkest times,
I was there for you,
In your darkest night,
But I wonder, where were you?,
When I was at my worst,
Down on my knees,
And you said you had my back,
So I wonder, where were you?,
All the roads you took came back to me,
So I'm following the map that leads to you youSong title is  youyouSong title is  youyou,

Tu bien sabes que yo te ando buscando,
Aunque en el tiempo pasó aun yo te sigo amando,
Tengo un mapa de papel,
Y camino sobre él,
Donde estés llegaré,
No tienes chance para escaparte,
Te sigo buscando por cielo y tierra,
Razón de ti nadie me da,
Pa' toda mi piel ya no hay mapa,
Que me conducirá,
Esto parece ficción,
Hasta en la televisión,
Como entender la canción que estoy haciendo,
Para encontrarte,
Y yo fui quien te acompañó en la oscuridad,
Quien nunca falló. Ehh,
But I wonder, where were you?,

Oh I was there for you,
Oh In your darkest times,
Oh I was there for you,
Oh In your darkest night,
But I wonder, where were you?,
When I was at my worst,
Down on my knees,
And you said you had my back,
So I wonder, where were you?,
All the roads you took came back to me,
So I'm following the map that leads to you youSong title is  youyouSong title is  youyou,

Song title is  Sunday morning
Yeah,
Sunday morning, rain is falling,
Steal some covers, share some skin,
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable,
You twist to fit the mold that I am in,
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do,
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew,
That someday it would lead me back to you,
That someday it would lead me back to you (someday),
That may be all I'll need (all I need),
In darkness, she is all I see (all I see),
Come and rest your bones with me,
Driving slow on Sunday morning,
And I never want to leave,
Fingers trace your every outline,
Paint a picture with my hands,
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm,
Change the weather, still together when it ends,
That may be all I'll need,
In darkness, she is all I see,
Come and rest your bones with me,
Driving slow on Sunday morning,
And I never want to leave, yeah,
Oh, ah yeah,
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do,
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you,
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you,
Find a way to bring myself back home to you,
You may not know that may be all I'll need,
In darkness, she is all I see (you are all I see),
Come and rest your bones with me,
Driving slow on Sunday morning (and I never want to leave),
Driving slow (yeah, yeah, ah, yeah, yeah),
Ah yeah, yeah (all I need),
Ah yeah, yeah,
Ah yeah, yeah,
Ah yeah, yeah,
There's flower in your hair,
I'm a flower in your hair, oh, oh yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, ah, whoa, oh, yeah whoo.


Song title is  Harder to breathe
How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable,
So condescending unnecessarily critical,
I have the tendency of getting very physical,
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle,
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here,
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear,
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone,
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on,
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love,
You'll understand what I mean when I say,
There's no way we're gonna give up,
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams,
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe,
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe,
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head,
You should know better you never listened to a word I said,
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat,
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did,
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love,
You'll understand what I mean when I say,
There's no way we're gonna give up,
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams,
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe,
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe,
Does it kill,
Does it burn,
Is it painful to learn,
That it's me that has all the control,
Does it thrill,
Does it sting,
When you feel what I bring,
And you wish that you had me to hold,
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love,
You'll understand what I mean when I say,
There's no way we're gonna give up,
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams,
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe,
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe,
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe.


Song title is  Won't go home without you
I asked her to stay,
But she wouldn't listen,
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh,
The words that would mend,
The things that were broken,
But now it's far too late; she's gone away,
Every night you cry yourself to sleep,
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?,
Why does every moment have to be so hard?",
Hard to believe that,
It's not over tonight,
Just give me one more chance to make it right,
I may not make it through the night,
I won't go home without you,
The taste of her breath,
I'll never get over,
The noises that you made kept me awake,
Oh,
The weight of the things that remained unspoken,
Built up so much it crushed us everyday,
Every night you cry yourself to sleep,
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?,
Why does every moment have to be so hard?",
Hard to believe that,
It's not over tonight,
Just give me one more chance to make it right,
I may not make it through the night,
I won't go home without you,
It's not over tonight,
Just give me one more chance to make it right,
I may not make it through the night,
I won't go home without you,
Of all the things I felt but never really shown,
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go,
I should not ever let you go, oh, oh, oh,
It's not over tonight,
Just give me one more chance to make it right,
I may not make it through the night,
I won't go home without you,
Oh, oh, oh,
It's not over tonight,
Just give me one more chance to make it right,
I may not make it through the night,
I won't go home without you,
And I won't go home without you,
And I won't go home without you,
And I won't go home without you.


Song title is  Makes me wonder
I wake up, with blood-shot eyes,
Struggled to memorize,
The way it felt between your thighs,
Pleasure that made you cry,
Feels so good to be bad,
Not worth the aftermath, after that,
After that,
Try to get you back,
I still don't have the reason,
And you don't have the time,
And it really makes me wonder,
If I ever gave a fuck about you,
Give me something to believe in,
'Cause I don't believe in you,
Anymore, anymore,
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try,
Yeah, so this is goodbye,
God damn, my spinning head,
Decisions that made my bed,
Now I must lay in it,
And deal with things I left unsaid,
I want to dive into you,
Forget what you're going through,
I get behind; make your move,
Forget about the truth,
I still don't have the reason,
And you don't have the time,
And it really makes me wonder,
If I ever gave a fuck about you,
Give me something to believe in,
'Cause I don't believe in you,
Anymore, anymore,
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try (yeah),
And you told me how you're feeling,
But I don't believe it's true,
Anymore, anymore,
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry,
(Oh no),
So this is goodbye,
I've been here before,
One day I'm wake up,
And it won't hurt anymore,
You caught me in a lie,
I have no alibi,
The words you say don't have a meaning,
Cause,
I still don't have the reason,
And you don't have the time,
And it really makes me wonder,
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I,
And so this is goodbye,
Give me something to believe in,
Cause I don't believe in you,
Anymore, anymore,
I wonder if it even makes a difference,
It even makes a difference to try,
And you told me how you're feeling,
But I don't believe it's true,
Anymore, anymore,
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry,
(Oh no),
So this is goodbye,
So this is goodbye, yeah,
So this is goodbye, yeah,
So this is goodbye, yeah.


Song title is  Wait,
Dirty looks from your mother,
Never seen you in a dress that color, no,
It's a special occasion,
Not invited but I'm glad I made it,
Oh, let me apologize,
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times,
Your love, I don't wanna lose,
I'm beggin', beggin', beginn', beggin', I'm begging you,
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?,
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?,
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you,
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?,
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?,
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you,
Can we talk for a moment?,
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holding on,
Wasn't tryin' to get wasted,
I needed more than three or four to say this,
Oh, let me apologize (yea),
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times),
Your love, I don't wanna lose,
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you,
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?,
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?,
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you,
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?,
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?,
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you,
You say I'm just another bad guy,
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo,
Before you tell me for the last time,
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you,
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?,
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?,
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you,
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?,
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?,
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you.


Song title is  Nobody's love

If you ever said goodbye,
Never let you go, I (never let you go, I),

Song title is  Misery,
Oh yeah,
Oh yeah,
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend,
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send,
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem,
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed,
So let me be,
And I'll set you free,
I am in misery,
There ain't nobody who can comfort me,
Oh yeah,
Why won't you answer me?,
The silence is slowly killing me,
Oh yeah,
Girl, you really got me bad,
You really got me bad,
Now I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna get you back,
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine,
The way it feels to be completely intertwined,
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know,
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show,
So let me be,
I'll set you free,
I am in misery,
There ain't nobody who can comfort me,
Oh yeah,
Why won't you answer me?,
The silence is slowly killing me,
Oh yeah,
Girl, you really got me bad,
You really got me bad,
Now I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna get you back,
You say your faith is shaken,
And you may be mistaken,
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun,
I'm desperate and confused,
So far away from you,
I'm getting near, I don't care where I have to run,
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah,
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah,
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah,
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah,
I am in misery,
There ain't nobody who can comfort me,
Oh yeah,
Why won't you answer me?,
The silence is slowly killing me,
Oh yeah,
Girl, you really got me bad,
You really got me bad,
Now I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna get you back,
Girl, you really got me bad,
You really got me bad,
Now I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna get you back,
Girl, you really got me bad,
You really got me bad,
Now I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna get you back...().


Song title is  Love somebody
I know your insides are feeling so hollow,
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah,
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover,
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same,

I really wanna dance the night away,
I know we're only half way there,
But you can take me all the way, if you take me all the way,

Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah,
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover,
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same,
I really wanna love somebody,
I really wanna dance the night away,
I know we're only half way there,
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way,
I really wanna touch somebody,

But you can take me all the way, if you can take me all the way,
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh,
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost,
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop,

Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah,
I really wanna love somebody,
I really wanna dance the night away,
I know we're only half way there,

Song title is  Cold,
Cold enough to chill my bones,
It feels like I don't know you anymore,
I don't understand why you're so cold to me,
With every breath you breathe,
I see there's something going on,
I don't understand why you're so cold,
Are we taking time or a time out?,
I can't take the in between,
Asking me for space here in my house,
You know how to fuck with me,
Acting like we're not together,
After everything that we've been through,
Sleeping up under the covers,
How am I so far away from you?,
Distant when we're kissing,
Feel so different,
Baby, tell me how did you get so...
Cold enough to chill my bones?,
It feels like I don't know you anymore,
I don't understand why you're so cold to me,
With every breath you breathe,
I see there's something going on,
I don't understand why you're so cold,
Why you're so,
Why you're so,
I don't understand why you're so,
Why you're so,
Why you're so,
I don't understand why you're so cold,
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?,
If you wanna leave just leave,
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?,
The silence is killing me,
Acting like we're not together,
If you don't want this, then what's the use?,
Sleeping up under the covers,
How am I so far away from you?,
Distant, oh, when we're kissing, yeah,
Feel so different, yeah.
Baby, tell me how did you get so...
Cold enough to chill my bones?,
It feels like I don't know you anymore,
I don't understand why you're so cold to me,
With every breath you breathe,
I see there's something going on,
I don't understand why you're so cold,
Why you're so,
Why you're so,
I don't understand why you're so,
Why you're so,
Why you're so,
I don't understand why you're so cold,
Never thought that you were like this,
I took the tag off and made you priceless,
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier,
Now you tryin'a cut me off like a light switch, yeah,
Tryna stay, and I leave,
Saying that you need some time to breathe,
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word,
But the four letter word don't sleep,
We goin' two separate ways,
You ain't been actin' the same,
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be,
You gold dig every day,
I switched the four door to the two door,
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say,
Girl, I tried to give you space,
Baby, tell me how did you get so,
Cold enough to chill my bones?,
It feels like I don't know you anymore,
I don't understand why you're so cold to me,
With every breath you breathe,
I see there's something going on,
I don't understand why you're so cold.


Song title is  Lips on you
You keep me connected to you,
Like I was your shadow,
You're givin' me answers,
To all of my questions,
Here on my pillow, oh,
Can't nothing get in between us, baby,
We've been waiting on this moment for so long,
You wanna be reckless, restless,
Right until tomorrow,
Wait,
When I put my lips on you,
You feel the shivers go up and down,
Your spine for me,
Make you cry for me,
When I put my lips on you,
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me,
Baby cry for me,
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
Just turn off the lights,
And you could be my private dancer,
When we close the curtains,
You and me can forget all our manners,
The neighbors must think we're crazy, baby,
'Cause look how easily we keep coming undone,
You wanna be reckless, restless,
Right until tomorrow,
Wait,
When I put my lips on you,
You feel the shivers go up and down,
Your spine for me,
Make you cry for me,
When I put my lips on you,
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me,
Baby cry for me,
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you,
You feel the shivers go up and down,
Your spine for me,
Make you cry for me,
When I put my lips on you,
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me,
Baby cry for me,
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I),
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I).


Song title is  Daylight,
Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon,
Why am I holding on?,
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along,
How did it come so fast?,
This is our last night but it's late,
And I'm trying not to sleep,
'Cause I know, when I wake,
I will have to slip away,
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go,
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close,
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own,
But tonight I need to hold you so close,
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa,
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa,
Here I am staring at your perfection,
In my arms, so beautiful,
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out,
Somebody slow it down,
This is way too hard,
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up,
I will leave, this is my last glance,
That will soon be memory,
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go,
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close,
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own,
But tonight I need to hold you so close,
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa,
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa,
I never wanted to stop,
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over,
I was afraid of the dark,
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want,
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go,
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close,
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own,
But tonight I need to hold you so close,
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go,
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close,
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own,
But tonight I need to hold you so close,
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa,
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa,
Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah),
Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa.


Song title is  Never gonna leave this bed
You push me, I don't have the strength to,
Resist or control you,
So take me down,
Take me down,
You hurt me, but do I deserve this,
You make me so nervous,
Calm me down,
Calm me down,
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,,
I will never walk away again,
I'm never gonna leave this bed,
So come here and never leave this place,
Perfection of your face,
Slows me down,
Slows me down,
So fall down I need you to trust me,
Go easy, don't rush me,
Help me out why don't you help me out,
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,,
I will never walk away again,
I'm never gonna leave this bed,
You say go,
It isn't working and I say no,
It isn't perfect so I'll stay instead,
I'm never gonna leave this bed,
Take it, take it all take all that I have,
I'd give it all away just to get you back,
And fake it, fake it I'll take what I can get,
Knocking so loud, can you hear me yet?,
Try to stay awake but you can't forget,
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,,
I will never walk away again,
I'm never gonna leave this bed,
Oh, you say go,
It isn't working and I say no,
It isn't perfect so I'll stay instead,
I'm never gonna leave this bed,
Take it, take it all take all that I have,
Take it, take it all take all that I have.


Song title is  If i never see you face again
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away,
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway,
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one,
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun,
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away,
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you),
But you feel my breath, on your neck,
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you),
'Cause you keep me coming back for more,
And I feel a little better than I did before,
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind,
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight,
Sometimes you move so well,
It's hard not to give in,
I'm lost, I can't tell,
Where you end and I begin,
It makes you burn to learn,
I'm with another man,
I wonder if he's half,
The lover that I am,
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away,
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you),
But you feel my breath, On your neck,
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you),
'Cause you keep me coming back for more,
And I feel a little better than I did before,
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind,
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight,
Baby, baby, please believe me,
Find it in your heart to reach me,
Promise not to leave me behind,
(Promise not to leave me behind),
Take me down, but take it easy,
Make me think but don't deceive me,
Torture me by taking your time,
(Talk to me, talk to me),
'Cause you keep me coming back for more,
And I feel a little better than I did before,
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind,
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight,
'Cause you keep me coming back for more,
And I feel a little better than I did before,
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind,
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight.


Song title is  This love
I was so high, I did not recognize,
The fire burning in her eyes,
The chaos that controlled my mind,
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane,
Never to return again,
But always in my heart,
This love has taken its toll on me,
She said goodbye too many times before,
And her heart is breaking in front of me,
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woah,
I tried my best to feed her appetite,
Keep her coming every night,
So hard to keep her satisfied,
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game,
Pretending to feel the same,
Then turn around and leave again,
But, oh, this love has taken its toll on me,
She said goodbye too many times before,
And her heart is breaking in front of me,
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore woah, woah, woah,
I'll fix these broken things,
Repair your broken wings,
And make sure everything is alright,
My pressure on your hips,
Sinking my fingertips,
Into every inch of you,
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do,
This love has taken its toll on me,
She said goodbye too many times before,
Her heart is breaking in front of me,
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore,
This love has taken its toll on me,
She said goodbye too many times before,
My heart is breaking in front of me,
She said goodbye too many times before,
This love has taken its toll on me,
She said goodbye too many times before,
Her heart is breaking in front of me,
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore.


Song title is  Lucky strike
You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here,
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir,
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game,
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her,
And I can't wait another minute,
I can't take the look she's giving,
You're body rocking, keep me up all night,
One in a million, my lucky strike,
Got me so high and then she dropped me,
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad,
Took me inside and then she rocked me,
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like,
(Oh) My lucky strike,
(Oh) My lucky strike,
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night,
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike,
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky,
And I don't wanna go down, go down,
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize,
She'll make me want her right now, right now,
And I can't wait another minute,
I can't take the look she's giving,
You're body rocking, keep me up all night,
One in a million, my lucky strike,
Got me so high and then she dropped me,
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad,
Took me inside and then she rocked me,
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like,
(Oh) My lucky strike,
(Oh) My lucky strike,
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night,
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike,
Hey, you're taking all my pain away,
You're shaking like an earthquake,
Hey, you're taking all my pain away,
You're shaking like an earthquake,
Got me so high and then she dropped me,
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad,
Took me inside and then she rocked me,
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like,
(Oh) My lucky strike,
(Oh) My lucky strike,
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night,
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike,
My lucky strike, my lucky strike,
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night,
(Oh) One in a million.


Song title is  This Summer's Gonna Hurt Like a Motherfucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
Her body's hot,
Her body's like the summer,
I'm in a trance or something,
Her mind is not, no,
As sharp as all her diamonds,
She must be smoking something,
I see her dancing in the streets,
Sipping champagne on the beach,
So expensive when she eats,
'Cause she's so fancy,
I see her when I go to sleep,
I check my phone when I am weak,
She never posts anything deep,
'Cause she's so fancy,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
She wants it all,
She's always taking something,
And now I'm left with nothing,
I'm ripping off, oh,
I'm ripping off that bandage,
Because I just can't stand it,
I see her dancing on a fool,
Like she's seventeen and cool,
She really thinks that she can move,
But it's just nasty,
I see her when I go to sleep,
I check my phone when I am weak,
She never posts anything deep,
'Cause she's so fancy,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
Has to have it all,
Chases every star,
She's so popular,
Has to have it all,
Chases every star,
She's so popular, oh,
This summer's gonna hurt,
It's gonna hurt,
I see her dancing in the street,
Sipping champagne on the beach,
So expensive when she eats,
'Cause she's so fancy,
'Cause she's so fancy,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker,
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker,
Fucker.


Song title is  Wakeup call
I didn't hear what you were saying,
I live on raw emotion, baby,
I answer questions, never maybe,
And I'm not kind if you betray me,
So, who the hell are you to save me?,
I never would have made it, babe,
If you needed love,
Well, then, ask for love,
Could have given love,
Now I'm taking love,
And it's not my fault,
'Cause you both deserve,
What's coming now,
So don't say a word,
Wake up call,
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed,
Don't you care about me anymore?,
Don't you care about me?,
I don't think so,
Six foot tall,
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead,
He won't come around here anymore,
Come around here?,
I don't think so,
Would have bled to make you happy,
You didn't need to treat me that way,
And now you beat me at my own game,
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly,
And your lover's screaming loudly,
I hear a sound and hit the ground,
If you needed love,
Well, then, ask for love,
Could have given love,
Now I'm taking love,
And it's not my fault,
'Cause you both deserve,
What's coming now,
So don't say a word,
Wake up call,
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed,
Don't you care about me anymore?,
Don't you care about me?,
I don't think so,
Six foot tall,
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead,
He won't come around here anymore,
Come around here?,
I don't feel so bad,
I don't feel so bad,
I don't feel so bad,
I'm so sorry, darling,
Did I do the wrong thing?,
Oh, what was I thinking?,
Is his heart still beating?,
Whoa, oh, oh,
Wake up call,
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed,
Don't you care about me anymore?,
Don't you care about me?,
I don't think so,
Six foot tall,
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead,
He won't come around here anymore,
Come around here?,
I don't feel so bad,
Wake up call,
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed,
Don't you care about me anymore?,
Don't you care about me?,
I don't think so,
Six foot tall,
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead,
He won't come around here anymore, no,
He won't come around here?,
I don't feel so bad.


Song title is  Must get out
I've been the needle and the thread,
Weaving figure eights and circles around your head,
I try to laugh but cry instead,
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said,
Fumbling through your dresser drawer,
Forgot what I was looking for,
Try to guide me in the right direction,
Making use of all this time,
Keeping everything inside,
Close my eyes and listen to you cry,
I'm lifting you up,
I'm letting you down,
I'm dancing till dawn,
I'm fooling around,
I'm not giving up,
I'm making your love,
This city's made us crazy and we must get out,
"This is not goodbye, " she said,
"It's just time for me to rest my head",
She does not walk, she runs instead,
Down these jagged streets and into my bed,
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer,
Forgot what I was looking for,
Try to guide me in the right direction,
Making use of all this time,
Keeping everything inside,
Close my eyes and listen to you cry,
I'm lifting you up,
I'm letting you down,
I'm dancing till dawn,
I'm fooling around,
I'm not giving up,
I'm making your love,
This city's made us crazy and we must get out,
There's only so much I can do for you,
After all of the things you've put me through,
I'm lifting you up,
I'm letting you down,
I'm dancing till dawn,
I'm fooling around,
I'm not giving up,
I'm making your love,
This city's made us crazy and we must get out,
I'm lifting you up,
I'm letting you down,
I'm dancing till dawn,
I'm fooling around,
I'm not giving up,
I'm making your love,
This city's made us crazy and we must get out,
I'm lifting you up (oh oh),
I'm letting you down (oh oh),
I'm dancing till dawn (oh oh),
I'm fooling around (oh oh),
I'm not giving up (oh oh),
I'm making your love (oh oh),
This city's made us crazy and we must get out (oh oh).


Song title is  Sweetest goodbye
Uh,
Uh, huh,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh,
Where you are seems to be,
As far as an eternity,
Outstretched arms open hearts,
And if it never ends then when do we start?,
I'll never leave you behind,
Or treat you unkind,
I know you understand, oh whoah,
And with a tear in my eye,
Give me the sweetest goodbye,
That I ever did receive,
Pushing forward and arching back,
Bring me closer to heart attack,
Say goodbye and just fly away,
When you comeback,
I have something to say, yeah,
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone,
When you get home, home,
There must be some place here that only you and I could go,
So I can show you how I,
Dream away everyday,
Try so hard to disregard,
The rhythm of the rain that drops,
And coincides with the beating of my heart,
I'll never leave you behind,
Or treat you unkind,
And I know you'll understand, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
And with a tear in my eye,
Give me the sweetest goodbye,
That I ever, ever, ever did receive,
Pushing forward and arching back,
Bring me closer to heart attack,
Say goodbye and just fly away,
When you comeback,
I have something to say, yeah,
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone,
When you get home, home,
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go,
So I can show you how I feel,
Feel,
Feel,
Feel,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Pushing forward and arching back (yeah, oh),
Bring me closer to heart attack,
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone,
When you get home, home,
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go,
So I can show you how I feel (show you how I feel, show you how I feel),
Show you how, show you, show,
Show you how I feel,
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go,
So I can show you how I feel (show you, show you, show you, show you, show).


Song title is  It was always you
Woke up sweating from a dream,
With a different kind of feeling, oh,
All day long my heart was beating,
Searching for the meaning, oh,
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind,
We were just wasting time, uh uh babe,
For my whole life, we never crossed the line,
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize,
It was always you,
Can't believe I could not see it all this time,
All this time,
It was always you,
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied,
Satisfied,
It was always you, you,
No more guessing who,
Looking back now I know it was always you,
Always you,
All my hidden desires,
Finally came alive, hmm,
No, I never told lies,
To you so why would I,
Start tonight,
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind,
We were just wasting time, uh uh yeah,
For my whole life, we never crossed the line,
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize,
It was always you,
Can't believe I could not see it all this time,
All this time,
It was always you,
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied,
Satisfied,
It was always you, you,
No more guessing who,
Looking back now I know it was always you,
Always you,
Ah, yeah (you, you, you, always you, you, you),
Ah, yeah (you, you, you, always you, you, you),
Woke up sweating from a dream,
With a different kind of feeling,
It was always you,
Even if I could not see it all this time,
All this time,
It was always you (always),
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied,
It was always you, you,
No more guessing who,
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you,
It was always you.

First things first,
I'ma say all the words inside my head,
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh,
The way that things have been, oh-ooh,
Second thing second,
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be,
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh,
The master of my sea, oh-ooh,
I was broken from a young age,
Taking my sulking to the masses,
Writing my poems for the few,
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me,
Singing from heartache from the pain,
Taking my message from the veins,
Speaking my lesson from the brain,
Seeing the beauty through the...,
Pain!,
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer,
Pain!,
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer,
Pain!,
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain,

Can you imagine what's about to happen?,
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons,
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin',
This is what's happenin',
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate,
Sound about accurate,
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy,
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities,
I know the passages come with some traffic,
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic,
And third thing third,
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count,
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh,
Is you a believer?,
I get a unicorn out of a zebra,
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo,
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather,
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader,
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain,
I know the losin' don't come without shame,
I know the beauty don't come without hurt,
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last,
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne,
I know that losin' don't come without game,
I know that glory don't come without...,
Don't come without...,
Pain!,
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer,
Pain!,

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer,
Last things last,
By the grace of fire and flames,
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh,
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh,
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing,
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down,
It rained down, like...,
Pain!,
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer,
Pain!,
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer,
Pain,
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain,
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...,
Pain!,
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer.


Song title is  Bad liar:
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year,
And terrors don't prey on,
Innocent victims,
Trust me, darling, trust me darling,
It's been a loveless year,
I'm a man of three fears,
Integrity, faith and,
Crocodile tears,
Trust me, darling, trust me, darling,

Tearing at the seams,

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar,
Now you know,
Now you know,

Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?,

Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems,
I wage my war, on the world inside,
I take my gun to the enemy's side,

Song title is  Thunder:
Just a young gun with a quick fuse,
I was uptight, wanna let loose,
I was dreaming of bigger things,
And wanna leave my old life behind,
Not a yes-sir, not a follower,
Fit the box, fit the mold,
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number,
I was lightning before the thunder,

Kids were laughing in my classes,
While I was scheming for the masses,
Who do you think you are?,
Dreaming 'bout being a big star,
They say you're basic, they say you're easy,
You're always riding in the back seat,
Now I'm smiling from the stage while,
You were clapping in the nosebleeds,

Song title is  Demons:
When the days are cold,
And the cards all fold,
And the saints we see,
Are all made of gold,
When your dreams all fail,
And the ones we hail,
Are the worst of all,
And the blood's run stale,
I wanna hide the truth,
I wanna shelter you,
But with the beast inside,
There's nowhere we can hide,
No matter what we breed,
We still are made of greed,
This is my kingdom come,
This is my kingdom come,
When you feel my heat,
Look into my eyes,
It's where my demons hide,
It's where my demons hide,
Don't get too close,
It's dark inside,
It's where my demons hide,
It's where my demons hide,
At the curtain's call,
It's the last of all,
When the lights fade out,
All the sinners crawl,
So they dug your grave,
And the masquerade,
Will come calling out,
At the mess you've made,
Don't wanna let you down,
But I am hellbound,
Though this is all for you,
Don't wanna hide the truth,
No matter what we breed,
We still are made of greed,
This is my kingdom come,
This is my kingdom come,
When you feel my heat,
Look into my eyes,
It's where my demons hide,
It's where my demons hide,
Don't get too close,
It's dark inside,
It's where my demons hide,
It's where my demons hide,
They say it's what you make,
I say it's up to fate,
It's woven in my soul,
I need to let you go,
Your eyes, they shine so bright,
I wanna save that light,
I can't escape this now,
Unless you show me how,
When you feel my heat,
Look into my eyes,
It's where my demons hide,
It's where my demons hide,
Don't get too close,
It's dark inside,
It's where my demons hide,
It's where my demons hide.


Song title is  Radioactive:
Whoa, oh, oh,
Whoa, oh, oh,
Whoa, oh, oh,
Whoa,
I'm waking up to ash and dust,
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust,
I'm breathing in the chemicals,
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus,
This is it, the apocalypse,
Whoa,
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones,
Enough to make my systems blow,
Welcome to the new age, to the new age,
Welcome to the new age, to the new age,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive,
I raise my flags, don my clothes,
It's a revolution, I suppose,
We'll paint it red to fit right in,
Whoa,
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus,
This is it, the apocalypse,
Whoa,
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones,
Enough to make my systems blow,
Welcome to the new age, to the new age,
Welcome to the new age, to the new age,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive,
All systems go, the sun hasn't died,
Deep in my bones, straight from inside,
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones,
Enough to make my systems blow,
Welcome to the new age, to the new age,
Welcome to the new age, to the new age,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive.


Song title is  Whatever it takes:
Falling too fast to prepare for this,
Tripping in the world could be dangerous,
Everybody circling, it's vulturous,
Negative, nepotist,
Everybody waiting for the fall of man,
Everybody praying for the end of times,
Everybody hoping they could be the one,
I was born to run, I was born for this,
Whip, whip,
Run me like a racehorse,
Pull me like a ripcord,
Break me down and build me up,
I wanna be the slip, slip,
Word upon your lip, lip,
Letter that you rip, rip,
Break me down and build me up,
Whatever it takes,
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins,
I do whatever it takes,
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains,
Whatever it takes,
Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for,
Whatever it takes,
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins,
I do what it takes,
Always had a fear of being typical,
Looking at my body feeling miserable,
Always hanging on to the visual,
I wanna be invisible,
Looking at my years like a martyrdom,
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em,
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son,
I was born to run, I was born for this,
Whip, whip,
Run me like a racehorse,
Pull me like a ripcord,
Break me down and build me up,
I wanna be the slip, slip,
Word upon your lip, lip,
Letter that you rip, rip,
Break me down and build me up,
Whatever it takes,
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins,
I do whatever it takes,
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains,
Whatever it takes,
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for,
Whatever it takes,
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins,
I do what it takes,
Hypocritical, egotistical,
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical,
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box,
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost,
I'm an apostrophe,
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see,
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe,
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased,
And when I am deceased,
At least I go down to the grave and die happily,
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee,
I do what it takes,
Whatever it takes,
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins,
I do whatever it takes,
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains,
Whatever it takes,
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for,
Whatever it takes,
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins,
I do what it takes.


Song title is  Natural:
Will you hold the line,
When every one of them is giving up or giving in? Tell me,
In this house of mine,
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me,
Will the stars align?,
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?,
'Cause this house of mine stands strong,
That's the price you pay,
Leave behind your heart and cast away,
Just another product of today,
Rather be the hunter than the prey,
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a,
Natural,
A beating heart of stone,
You gotta be so cold,
To make it in this world,
Yeah, you're a natural,
Living your life cutthroat,
You gotta be so cold,
Yeah, you're a natural,
Will somebody,
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?,
What's happening?,
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing,
Oh, we are the youth,
Cut until it bleeds, inside a world without the peace facing,
A bit of the truth, the truth,
That's the price you pay,
Leave behind your heart and cast away,
Just another product of today,
Rather be the hunter than the prey,
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a,
Natural,
A beating heart of stone,
You gotta be so cold,
To make it in this world,
Yeah, you're a natural,
Living your life cutthroat,
You gotta be so cold,
Yeah, you're a natural,
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading,
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it,
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear,
I'm gonna make it,
I'm gonna make it,
Natural,
A beating heart of stone,
You gotta be so cold,
To make it in this world,
Yeah, you're a natural,
Living your life cutthroat,
You gotta be so cold,
Yeah, you're a natural,
Natural,
Yeah, you're a natural.


Song title is  Sucker for pain:
I torture you,
Take my hand through the flames,
I torture you,
I'm a slave to your games,
I'm just a sucker for pain,
I wanna chain you up,
I wanna tie you down,
Ooh,
I'm just a sucker for pain (Dolla $ign),
I'm a sucker for pain,
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles,
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion (yeah),
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure (ooh, yeah),
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog,
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for,
Alienated by society,
All this pressure give me anxiety (anxiety),
Walk slow through the fire,
Like, who gon' try us?,
Feelin' the world go against us (against us),
So we put the world on our shoulders,
I torture you,
Take my hand through the flames,
I torture you,
I'm a slave to your games,
I'm just a sucker for pain,
I wanna chain you up,
I wanna tie you down,
Ooh,
I'm just a sucker for pain,
I been at it with my homies,
It don't matter, you don't know me,
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene,
I been ridin' 'round the city with my squad,
I been ridin' 'round the city with my squad,
We just posted, gettin' crazy, livin' like this is so amazin',
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, 'cause I know what,
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in,
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion,
I know I been bustin', no discussion for my family,
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy,
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna reload up,
Yes, I reload up, I know what up, I know what up,
I torture you,
Take my hand through the flames,
I torture you,
I'm a slave to your games,
I'm just a sucker for pain,
I wanna chain you up,
I wanna tie you down,
Ooh,
I'm just a sucker for pain,
Uh, devoted to destruction,
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction,
I'm dyin' slow but the devil tryna rush me,
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy,
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat,
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat,
Eatin' peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast,
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke,
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole,
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul,
And only Lord knows when I'm comin' to the crossroads,
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow,
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothin' but pain,
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim,
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne,
I'ma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train,
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain,
Used to doin' bad, now we feel like we just now gettin' it,
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it,
No pain, no gain,
Never stand down, made our own way,
Never goin' slow, we pick up the pace,
This is what we wanted from a young age,
No emotion, that's what business is,
Lord, have mercy on the witnesses,
I torture you,
Take my hand through the flames,
I torture you,
I'm just a sucker for pain,
More pain,
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin',
For more pain,
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin',
For more pain,
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin',
For more pain,
Got me beggin'.


Song title is  Warriors:
As a child you would wait,
And watch from far away,
But you always knew that you'd be the one,
That work while they all play,
In youth you'd lay,
Awake at night and scheme,
Of all the things that you would change,
But it was just a dream!,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town,
From dust.,
Will come,
When you'll have to rise,
Above the best and prove yourself,
Your spirit never dies!,
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,
But don't weep for me,
'Cause this will be,
The labor of my love,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town,
From dust.,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town,
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town,
From dust.


Song title is  It's time:
So this is what you meant,
When you said that you were spent,
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top,
Don't hold back,
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check,
I don't ever want to let you down,
I don't ever want to leave this town,
'Cause after all,
This city never sleeps at night,
It's time to begin, isn't it?,
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit,
I'm just the same as I was,
Now don't you understand,
I'm never changing who I am,
So this is where you fell,
And I am left to sell,
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top,
Don't look back,
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check,
I don't ever want to let you down,
I don't ever want to leave this town,
'Cause after all,
This city never sleeps at night,
It's time to begin, isn't it?,
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit,
I'm just the same as I was,
Now don't you understand,
I'm never changing who I am,
It's time to begin, isn't it?,
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit,
I'm just the same as I was,
Now don't you understand,
I'm never changing who I am,
This road never looked so lonely,
This house doesn't burn down slowly,
To ashes,
To ashes,
It's time to begin, isn't it?,
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit,
I'm just the same as I was,
Now don't you understand,
I'm never changing who I am,
It's time to begin, isn't it?,
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit,
I'm just the same as I was,
Now don't you understand,
I'm never changing who I am.


Song title is  I's so sorry:
About time for anyone telling you off for all your deeds,
No sign the roaring thunder stopped in cold to read,
No time,
Get mine and make no excuses waste of precious breath,
No time,
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death,
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go,
You'll never be loved till you've made your own,
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours,
You never know the top till you get too low,
A son of a stepfather,
A son of a,
I'm so sorry,
A son of a stepfather,
A son of a,
I'm so sorry,
No lies and no deceiving, that is what he loves,
I keep tryin' to conceive that death is from above,
No time,
I get by and make no excuses waste of precious breath,
No time,
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death,
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go,
You'll never be loved till you've made your own,
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours,
You never know the top till you get too low,
A son of a stepfather,
A son of a,
I'm so sorry,
A son of a stepfather,
A son of a,
I'm so sorry,
Life isn't always what you think it'd be,
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn,
And I know, I know that I did you wrong,
But will you trust me when I say that I'll,
Make it up to you somehow, somehow,
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go,
You'll never be loved till you've made your own,
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours,
You never know the top till you get too low,
A son of a stepfather,
A son of a,
I'm so sorry,
A son of a stepfather,
A son of a,
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry,
A son of.

If you love somebody,
Better tell them why they're here 'cause,
They just may run away from you,
You'll never know what went well,
Then again it just depends on,
How long of time is left for you,

Take it with me if I can,
Been dreaming of this since a child,
I'm on top of the world.

Two hearts, one valve,
Pumpin' the blood,
We were the flood,
We were the body, and,
Two lives, one life,
Stickin' it out,
Lettin' you down,

Song title is  I bet my life:
I know I took the path that you would never want for me,
I know I let you down, didn't I?,
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me,
Well I'm just a slave unto the night,
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me,
Remember when I broke you down to tears,
I know I took the path that you would never want for me,
I gave you hell through all the years,
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life,
I bet my life for you,
I, I bet my life, I bet my life,
I bet my life for you,
I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams,
Would I come running home to you,
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth,
There's you in everything I do,
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me,
Remember when I broke you down to tears,
I know I took the path that you would never want for me,
I gave you hell through all the years,
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life,
I bet my life for you,
I, I bet my life, I bet my life,
I bet my life for you,
Don't tell me that I'm wrong,
I've walked that road before,
And left you on your own,
And please believe them when they say,
That it's left for yesterday,
And the records that I've played,
Please forgive me for all I've done,
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life,
I bet my life for you,
I, I bet my life, I bet my life,
I bet my life for you,
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my,
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my.


Song title is  Next to me:
Something about the way that you walked into my living room,
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am,
But still you, still you want me,
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics and deficits,
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin',
But still you, still you want me,
Oh, I always let you down,
You're shattered on the ground,
But still I find you there,
Next to me,
And oh, stupid things I do,
I'm far from good, it's true,
But still I find you,
Next to me (next to me),
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view,
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless,
And still you, still you want me,
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege,
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts,
And still you, still you want me,
Oh, I always let you down,
You're shattered on the ground,
But still I find you there,
Next to me,
And oh, stupid things I do,
I'm far from good, it's true,
But still I find you,
Next to me,
So thank you for taking a chance on me,
I know it isn't easy,
But I hope to be worth it (oh),
So thank you for taking a chance on me,
I know it isn't easy,
But I hope to be worth it (oh),
Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down),
You're shattered on the ground (shattered on the ground),
But still I find you there,
Next to me,
And oh, stupid things I do (stupid things I do),
I'm far from good, it's true,
But still I find you,
Next to me (next to me).


Song title is  Walking the wire:
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?,
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?,
We could turn around, or we could give it up,
But we'll take what comes, take what comes,
Oh, the storm is raging against us now,
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down,
But we took the step, and we took the leap,
And we'll take what comes, take what comes,
Feel the wind in your hair,
Feel the rush way up here,
We're walking the wire, love,
We're walking the wire, love,
We're gonna be higher, up,
We're walking the wire, wire, wire,
There's nights we had that just walk away,
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade,
It's the price we pay when it comes to love,
And we'll take what comes, take what comes,
Feel the wind in your hair,
Feel the rush way up here,
We're walking the wire, love,
We're walking the wire, love,
We're gonna be higher, up,
We're walking the wire, wire, wire,
So look out down below,
Look out down below,
Look out down below,
Walking the wire, wire, wire,
So look out down below,
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars,
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course,
I promise you from up above,
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love,
We're walking the wire, love,
We're walking the wire, love,
We're gonna be higher, up,
We're walking the wire, wire, wire,
So look out down below,
Look out down below,
Look out down below,
Walking the wire, wire, wire,
So look out down below,
We're walking the wire,
We're walking the wire,
We're walking the wire, wire, wire.


Song title is  Not today:
There she goes in front of me,
Take my life and set me free again,
We'll make a memory out of it,
Holy road is at my back,
Don't look on, take me back again,

We finally fall apart and we break each other's hearts,
If we wanna live young, love, we better start today,
It's gotta get easier, oh easier somehow,
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling,
Oh easier and easier somehow,
Oh I'm calling, I'm calling,
And it isn't over, unless it is over,
I don't wanna wait for that,

Song title is  who we are:
Up in the morning,
Up in the evening,
Picking down talks when the birds get back to me.,
Oh, to me.,
Up on the mountain,
Down in the king's lair,
Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.,
Oh, afternoon.,
We were never welcome here,
We were never welcome here at all.,
No.,
It's who we are.,
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.,
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.,
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.,
Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.,
Ooh.,
Up in the attic,
Down in the cellar,
Lost in a static,
Coming back for more.,
Oh, for more.,
Out with the reason,
In with the season,
Taking down names in my book of jealousy.,
Jealousy.,
We were never welcome here.,
We were never welcome here at all.,
No.,
It's who we are.,
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.,
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.,
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.,
Because it's who we are.,
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.,
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.,
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.,
Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.,
Ooh.,
They say we're crazy.,
They say we're crazy.,
They say we're crazy.,
They say we're crazy.,
They say we're crazy.,
They say we're crazy.,
They say we're crazy.,
They say we're, crazy.,

Why won't you save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.,
Ooh..


Song title is  Zero:
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most,
Find a little bit of steady as I get close,
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos,
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod,
I remember walking in the cold of November,
Hoping that I make it to the end of December,
Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but,
Holding to the thought of another time, but,
Looking to the ways of the ones before me,
Looking for the path of the young and lonely,
I don't want to hear about what to do,
I don't want to do it just to do it for you,
Hello, hello,
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero,
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel,
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real,
I'm looking for a way out,
Hello, hello,
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero,
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel,
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real,
I'm looking for a way out,
I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away,
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way,
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos,
Send me up, send me down, semi never demigod,
I remember walking in the heat of the summer,
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder,
Twenty-seven years and I've nothing to show,
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow,
Looking to the ways of the ones before me,
Looking for the path of the young and lonely,
I don't want to hear about what to do, no,
I don't want to do it just to do it for you,
Hello, hello,
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero,
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel,
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real,
I'm looking for a way out,
Hello, hello,
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero,
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel,
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real,
I'm looking for a way out,
Let me tell you 'bout it,
Well let me tell you 'bout it,
Maybe you're the same as me,
Let me tell you 'bout it,
Well let me tell you 'bout it,
They say the truth will set you free,
Hello, hello,
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero,
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel,
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real,
I'm looking for a way out,
Hello, hello,
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero,
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel,
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real,
I'm looking for a way out.


Song title is  Monster:Imagine dragons:
Ever since I could remember,
Everything inside of me,
Just wanted to fit in (oh, oh, oh, oh),
I was never one for pretenders,
Everything I tried to be,
Just wouldn't settle in (oh, oh, oh, oh),
If I told you what I was,
Would you turn your back on me?,
And if I seem dangerous,
Would you be scared?,
I get the feeling just because,
Everything I touch isn't dark enough,
If this problem lies in me,
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me,
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,
And it keeps getting stronger,
Can I clear my conscience,
If I'm different from the rest,
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh, oh),
I never said that I want this,
This burden came to me,
And it's made it's home inside (oh, oh, oh, oh),
If I told you what I was,
Would you turn your back on me?,
And if I seem dangerous,
Would you be scared?,
I get the feeling just because,
Everything I touch isn't dark enough,
If this problem lies in me,
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me,
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,
And it keeps getting stronger,
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me,
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,
And it keeps getting stronger.


Song title is  Bleeding out:
I'm bleeding out,
Said if the last thing that I do,
Is to bring you down,
I'll bleed out for you,
So I bear my skin,
And I count my sins,
And I close my eyes,
And I take it in,
And I'm bleeding out,
I'm bleeding out for you (for you),
When the day has come,
But I've lost my way around,
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground,
When the sky turns gray,
And everything is screaming,
I will reach inside,
Just to find my heart is beating,
You tell me to hold on,
Oh you tell me to hold on,
But innocence is gone,
And what was right is wrong,
'Cause I'm bleeding out,
Said if the last thing that I do,
Is to bring you down,
I'll bleed out for you,
So I bear my skin,
And I count my sins,
And I close my eyes,
And I take it in,
And I'm bleeding out,
I'm bleeding out for you (for you),
When the hour is nigh,
And hopelessness is sinking in,
And the wolves all cry,
To feel they're not worth hollering,
When your eyes are red,
And emptiness is all you know,
With the darkness fed,
I will be your scarecrow,
You tell me to hold on,
Oh you tell me to hold on,
But innocence is gone,
And what was right is wrong,
'Cause I'm bleeding out,
Said if the last thing that I do,
Is to bring you down,
I'll bleed out for you,
So I bear my skin,
And I count my sins,
And I close my eyes,
And I take it in,
And I'm bleeding out,
I'm bleeding out for you (for you),
I'm bleeding out for you (for you),
I'm bleeding out for you (for you),
I'm bleeding out for you (for you),
I'm bleeding out for you,
'Cause I'm bleeding out,
Said if the last thing that I do,
Is to bring you down,
I'll bleed out for you,
So I bear my skin,
And I count my sins,
And I close my eyes,
And I take it in,
And I'm bleeding out,
I'm bleeding out for you (for you).


Song title is  Battle cry:
Just one more time before I go,
I'll let you know,
That all this time I've been afraid,
Wouldn't let it show,
Nobody can save me now, no,
Nobody can save me now,
Stars are only visible in darkness,
Fear is ever-changing and evolving,
And I, I feel poison inside,
And I, I feel so alive,
Nobody can save you now,
King is crown, it's do or die,
Nobody can save you now,
The only sound,
It's the battle cry,
It's the battle cry,
It's the battle cry,
Nobody can save you now,
It's do or die,
Nobody can save you now,
King is crown, it's do or die,
Nobody can save you now,
The only sound,
It's the battle cry,
It's the battle cry,
It's the battle cry,
Nobody can save you now,
It's do or die,
Just one more time before I go,
I'll let you know,
That all this time I've been afraid,
Wouldn't let it show,
Nobody can save me now, no,
Nobody can save me now.


Song title is  I don't know why:
We could be strangers in the night,
We could be passing in the shadows,
We couldn't be closer if we tried,
When we're caught in the headlights,
We could be faces in the crowd,
We could be passing in the shadows,
Upping the risk of being found,
When we're caught in the headlights,
Dangerous,
Your love is always dangerous,
And now I'm lost in us,
We're livin' in a lying trust,
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you,
To do with you,
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you,
To do with you,
I was a faking alibi,
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh,
We were the essence of desire,
And we're caught in the headlights,
Dangerous,
Your love is always dangerous,
And now I'm lost in us,
We're livin' in a lying trust,
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you,
To do with you,
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you,
To do with you (I don't know why),
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know),
To do with you (I don't know why),
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you,
To do with you,
That you love me,
Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you love me (dangerous),
Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you love me (your love is always dangerous),
Tell me that you love me,
I don't know why,
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know),
To do with you (I don't know why),
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (do with, do with, do with),
To do with you (I don't know why),
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know),
To do with you (I don't know why),
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you,
To do with you.

Song title is  Shots:
Am I out of touch?,
Am I out of my place?,
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space,
Oh, I'm wishing you're here,
But I'm wishing you're gone,
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong,
Oh, I'm going to mess this up,
Oh, this is just my luck,
Over and over and over again,
In the meantime we let it go,
At the roadside we used to know,
We can let this drift away,
Oh, we let this drift away,
And there's always time to change your mind,
Oh, there's always time to change your mind,
Oh, there's always time to change your mind,
Oh, love, can you hear me?,
I'm sorry for everything,
Oh, everything I've done,
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun,
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved,
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved,
Am I out of luck?,
Am I waiting to break?,
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape,
Oh, I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted,
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong,
Oh, I'm going to mess this up,
Oh, this is just my luck,
Over and over and over again,
In the meantime we let it go,
At the roadside we used to know,
We can let this drift away,
Oh, we let this drift away,
And there's always time to change your mind,
Oh, there's always time to change your mind,
Oh, there's always time to change your mind,
Oh, love, can you hear me?,
I'm sorry for everything,
Oh, everything I've done,
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun,
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved,
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved.


Song title is  Ready aim fire:
With our backs to the wall,
The darkness will fall,
We never quite thought,
We could lose it all,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire,
An empire is falling,
In just one day,
You close your eyes,
And the glory fades,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away,
Off in the distance,
There is resistance,
Bubbling up and festering,
Hey mr motion,
Make me a potion,
Shake it all up,
With your mistery,
How come I've never seen,
Your face around here,
I know every single face,
Around here,
A man on a mission,
Changing the vision,
I was never welcome here,
We don't have the choice to stay,
We'd rather die than,
Do it your way,
With our backs to the wall,
The darkness will fall,
We never quite thought,
We could lose it all,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire,
An empire is falling,
In just one day,
You close your eyes,
And the glory fades,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away,
Checking the casing,
Shaking and pacing,
This is the tunnels life,
Blood in the writting,
Stuck in the fighting,
Look through the riffle's sight,
How come I've never seen,
Your face around here,
I know every single face,
Around here,
Hearing the echo,
Holding the shackle,
I was never welcome here,
We don't have the choice to stay,
We'd rather die than,
Do it your way,
With our backs to the wall,
The darkness will fall,
We never quite thought,
We could lose it all,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire,
An empire is falling,
In just one day,
You close your eyes,
And the glory fades,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away,
Oh,
Oh oh,
Oh,
Oh oh oh,
Oh oh,
Oh,
With our backs to the wall,
The darkness will fall,
We never quite thought,
We could lose it all,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire,
An empire is falling,
In just one day,
You close your eyes,
And the glory fades,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away,
Ready aim fire,
Ready aim fire away.

Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable,
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin',
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition,

Song title is  I'll make it up to you:
Took your heart, took your hand,
Promised you all that I had,
Hoping that you understand,
I'm far from a perfect man,
'Cause honey it's been a hard year,
It seems like we're going nowhere,
You're crying inside your bedroom,
Baby I know it's not fair,
Lay with me, for one more night,
I promise you, I'll make it right,
I'll make it up to you (you, you),
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you),
Every night, I'll make it up to you,
I know you don't understand,
the vices that follow a man,
And in your eyes I can see,
the places that you'd rather be,
Cause honey it's been a hard year,
It seems like we're going nowhere,
You're crying inside your bedroom,
Baby I know it's not fair,
I'll make it up to you (you, you),
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you),
Every night, I'll make it up to you,
In my darkest hour, in the dead of the night I'll make it up to you,
Your hands are mine, I'll make it up to you,
Promises are nothing more than fleeting thoughts,
But you, you are my life babe,
I'll make it up to you (every night),
I'll make it up to you,
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you),
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you),
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you),
Every night, I'll make it up to you.

Song title is  Rise up:
I was hoping for an indication,
I was seeking higher elevation,
Ay, ay, ay,
Ay, ay, ay,
I've been shaken wakin' in the night light,
I've been breakin' hiding from the spotlight,
Ay, ay, ay,
Ay, ay, ay,
The more I stray the less I fear,
And the more I reach the more I fade away,
The darkness right in front of me,
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away,
I would always open up the door,
Always looking up at higher floors,
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up),
I was always up for the making changes,
Walking down the street and meeting strangers,
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up),
Like a prayer that only needs a reason,
Like a hunter waiting for the season,
Ay, ay, ay,
Ay, ay, ay,
I was there but I was always leaving,
I believe it, that I was never breathing,
Ay, ay, ay,
Ay, ay, ay,
The more I stray the less I fear,
And the more I reach the more I fade away,
The darkness right in front of me,
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away,
I would always open up the door,
Always looking up at higher floors,
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up),
I was always up for the making changes,
Walking down the street and meeting strangers,
Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up),
I'm bursting like the 4th of July,
So color me and blow me away,
I'm broken in the prime of my life,
So embrace it and leave me to stray,
I would always open up the door,
Always looking up at higher floors,
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up),
I was always up for the making changes,
Walking down the street and meeting strangers,
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up),
I would always open up the door,
Always looking up at higher floors,
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up),
I was always up for the making changes,
Walking down the street and meeting strangers,
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up).


Song title is  Bullet in a gun:
The Roman king, the Romulus,
The precipice, born to change,
The final days, the last appraise,
Augustus, Nero, taking names,
I'm high, then I'm low, low,
Stop, then I go, go,
Bipolar, oh, oh,
Yes, then I'm no, no,
My time will come, I promise that,
Pull the trigger back, back,

Like a bullet in a gun,
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one,
Bullet in a gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey),
Gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey),
Bullet in a gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey),
Gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey),

To wear the crown, rise up from the ground,
I'm high, then I'm low, low,
Stop, then I go, go,

How many voices go unheard?,
How many lessons never learned?,
How many artists fear the light,
Fear the pain, go insane?,
Lose the mind, lose the self,
(You only care about fame and wealth),
Sellout, sellout, sellout,
Bullet in a gun (hey),
But in the end, my time will come,
Like a bullet in a gun,
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one,
Bullet in a gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey),

Song title is Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me,
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy,
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know,
Somebody to have, somebody to hold,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain.

Chorus:
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall,
And you're not here to get me through it all,
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug,
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

Verse 2:
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to,
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you,
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear,
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape.

Chorus:
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall,
And you're not here to get me through it all,

Song title is Before You Go by Lewis Capaldi:
 Verse 1:
I fell by the wayside like everyone else,
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself,
Our every moment, I start to replace,
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say.

Pre-Chorus:
When you hurt under the surface,
Like troubled water running cold,
Well, time can heal, but this won't.

Chorus:
So before you go,
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?,
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather,
So before you go,
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?,
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless,
So before you go.

Verse 2:
Was never the right time whenever you called,
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all,
Our every moment, I start to replay,
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face,

 Verse 1:
Counting days, counting days,
Since my love up and got lost on me,
And every breath that I've been taking,
Since you left feels like a waste on me,

That you'll come back when you can find some peace,
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken,
Since you left feels like a hollow street.

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind,
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind,
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side.

Song title is Forever by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober,
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99,
Just like old times all over,
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever,
I really wish that I dressed up a little better,
No regrets is what we said,
We can't go back again.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.

Verse 2:
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table,
Wish you the best, I would if I was able,
Morning light, it stings a little,
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling,
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking,
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever,

Take those long summer days,
When love was untamed,
Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.

How could you let somethin' so good,
Go to waste and bleed the colours out?.

Pre-Chorus:
You don't know what you got till it's gone,
Know when it's right till it's wrong,
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along,
You broke her heart down with ease,
Now I'm pickin' up every piece,
You must be so hard to please.

Chorus:

Thank you for all the mistakes,
Thank you for all of the pain,

Away.

You had your mind set out on other things,

Song title is Fade by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
It ain't no wonder why we lose control,
When we're always a heart attack away from falling in love,

To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far,
Running near on empty,
I wish somebody would've told me.

But don't fade away.

Song title is Wish You The Best by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I miss knowing what you're thinking,
And hearing how your day has been,
Do you think you could tell me everything, darling?,
But leave out every part about him,
Right now, you're probably by the ocean,
While I'm still out here in the rain,
With every day that passes by since we've spoken,
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA.

Pre-Chorus:
Maybe it's supposed to be this way.

Chorus:
But, oh, my love,
I wanna say, I miss the green in your eyes,
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied,

And you were everything I need all along,
I wanna say, I wish that you never left,
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best.

Song title is Maybe by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I've said a thousand things before,
I've fallen in and out of love,
I couldn't walk but tried to run,
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up,
A thousand times, I said too much,
Always second-guess before I jump,
I gave my all, but not enough,
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough.

Pre-Chorus:
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?,
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get.

Chorus:
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold,
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go,
And I ain't trying to be lonely, solely,
But everything I touch turns to stone,
Maybe I'm better off on my own.

Verse 2:
A thousand times, I've heard the same,
I've heard some other voices in my head,
Let me assure you that my mind's in check,
I just can't put my faith in something we might live to regret,

Song title is Headspace by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Salt of the earth, my friend,
It's all that we are in the end,
Well, you trapped down all the lines you drew,
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry, I don't want the bruise,
Your voice gets a little loud,
When there's nothing to talk about, you shout, dear.

And I'll find my lights fading out,
More and more by the hour,
It gets dark in here.

If you got time enough for me,
Sing me a song and send me to sleep,
Slip into my headspace while I dream,
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me.

Dust to dust, my friend,
Well, you're only blood and bones,
And I know your heart's at war with your head,
I am sure it hurt to see,
You're more than I'll ever have,
And more than I'll ever be,
I know it's a little late,
My timing was never great,
But I'm calling, dear,

I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet,
Until you opened your mouth,
And you said you loved.

 Verse 1: Lewis Capaldi:
The space between where our ends meet,
Has grown too much for me to block it out,
I miss the tone of your heartbeat,
It's such a warming and familiar sound,
I hope you're finding the power,
To help you make it through the darker days,
For now, I wait by the hour,
If you wanna take somebody’s breath away.

I hope you’re lonely, hope you’re lost 'cause I've been,
And I'd hate to think you're better off without me,
I know we tried to hold on, but where do you go,
When love, it just ain't enough?,
Now does it kill you when you think about me?,
Are you as close to giving up as I've been?,
I know we kept losing touch, got lost in the rush,
I pray you don't hurt too much.

Verse 2: Jessie Reyez:
I don’t come close to an angel,
You ain’t never been no kind of saint,
But when we both came together,
Hell to heaven, you were my escape,
But fires don't burn forever,
And all these ashes crumble when we touch,
We danced to death in the fire,
What can we do now that the music's done, my love?,

Song title is Tough by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece of you,
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew,
Is holding onto you,
And every waking hour I spend,
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed,
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead,
If every hope of you is dead.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause every night since you cut and run,
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one,
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking,
With every step that you're taking.

Chorus:
'Cause you've been running circles 'round,
My mind, turning me inside out,
And I fell for you but hit the ground,
'Cause the only love I've known has let me,
Down and I need lifting up,
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough,
And I'm praying I can pray enough,
So waking up without you ain’t so tough.

Verse 2:
Find it hard to find my feet,
When I keep on stumbling over you and me,
But I keep on trying 'cause I know I need,
To outrun the memories,
You might also likePre-Chorus:
And every day I'm reminded of,
The way I let it come undone,
I feel like the lonely one, the only one with time worth wasting,
Well, I still can't stop chasing.

Chorus:
'Cause you've been running circles 'round,
My mind, turning me inside out,
And I fell for you but hit the ground,
'Cause the only love I've known has let me,
Down and I need lifting up,
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough,
And I'm praying I can pray enough,
So waking up without you ain’t so tough, oh,
Tough, oh, tough,
So waking up without you.

Bridge:
Say I,
Thought I was talking to you,
Say I,
I guess I'm talking to myself,
Me and nobody else.

Chorus:
'Cause you've been running circles 'round,
My mind, turning me inside out,
And I fell for you but hit the ground,
'Cause the only love I've known has let me,
Down and I need lifting up,
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough,
And I'm praying I can pray enough,
So waking up without you ain’t so tough.

Feeling like I'm falling even further behind,

Tried to reach ya, tried to call,
I bang my head against your door,
But there ain't nobody home.

And meet you out in the wild,

Song title is Haven’t You Ever Been In Love Before? by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Don't put your cover up, you know it's bad for your health,
And, when the going's tough, you're way too hard on yourself,
I wish you'd open up, and I'd lend a little to help,
Before you dive off the deep end.

Pre-Chorus:
Well, you hold me like you want me,
But you don't give me nothin' else,
Feel this happening, but you feel absent,
Can you tell me what it is?.

And she said this,
Haven't you ever been in love before?,
You heard 'em say, it takes the pain away,
And it's a feelin' that you can't ignore,
But it's more like a knife to mе than a high to me,
And my heart can't fall apart anymore,
If you knеw what I knew, you'd be terrified,
Haven't you ever been in love before?.

Verse 2:
If we don't work it out, that's something I could accept,

Song title is Heavenly Kind Of State Of Mind by Lewis Capaldi:

It's almost cruel, the blue in your eyes,
The kind of blasphemy that makes a congregation cry,
When I'm with you, it's like nothing else,
Like I could run and tell the Devil to go fuck himself.

Whether you were heaven-sent to save mе from above,
Or the only one who doеsn't hate me, that's enough,

Since she told me we were through,

But I've been missing something,
Bring your body home to me.

Through.

Now it's only the beat of my heart,

Song title is Something in the Water by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
The darkest sense I get when I'm in the open,
When the ground beneath my feet starts falling away,
The cold cold press I find when I'm sick and soulless,
Or the warmth I feel at the end of a damp cigarette.

That keeps me from drowning,
Something in the tide,
That pulls me away,
Something in the water,
That keeps me from drowning,
Something in the tide,
That pulls me away.

Afraid to run my mouth in case my words escape me,
Cautious when I speak scared of what I might say,
Hang me out to dry when the wars are all over,

The misery I carried to keep me some company,
Is it lost on me when I don't have that much to say.

Chorus:
There must be something in the water,
That keeps me from drowning,
Something in the tide,
That pulls me away,

Song title is Any Kind Of Life by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
You were the raging storm that wrecked,
A beautiful mind I can't forget,
Knew from the moment that we met I'd take you home,
But, now that the future's so unclear,
Have all of your feelings disappeared?,
'Cause I'm in no kind of frame of mind to let you go.

Pre-Chorus:
Hope, have you some that I can borrow?,
'Cause I've been so low,
And the weight of all the world's a heavy load,
Keep me going till tomorrow,
'Cause I just don't know if I can face another day alone.

Chorus:
Well, my lungs don't breathe,
And my heart don't beat,
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here,
And I can't move on,
'Cause it feels so wrong,
No, I just don't want any kind of life without you, dear.

Verse 2:
Are there any words that I could say?,
I'm feeling our moment fade away,
In a matter of hours, we'll be drowning in the waves,
And, all of the memories that we shaped,
We're leaving behind, here in my wake,
If we can save the good we gave, we shouldn't wait,

Outro:
Now you're not here, I can't explain,
The carousel of my constant pain,
I'm not sure that I can hold on anymore,
Became a victim of circumstance,
Should've said when I had the chance,
I don't want any kind of life without you here.

Song title is Days Gone Quiet by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Now that we're bleeding,
Broken and scarred,
Thought we were finished,
And yet here we are,
Stuck in the same place,
Despite what we overcame,
Sometimes don't it make you wonder, darling,
When will it come to an end?.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause the price we pay,
Left a mark that stains,
And I don't think I'll ever be the same.

Chorus:
We might've kept the black at bay,
But all around it still remains,
Lord only knows for evermore,
What horizons hold for us in store,
Looks like there's no way around,
But I know I'll try somehow,
At least it's all gone quiet for now.

Verse 2:
Tomorrow don't mean much,
In the waters we wade,
And my secrets are waiting for me,
When I get to my grave,

Song title is Figure it Out by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Broken by desire to be heavenly sent,
Divinely uninspired to a hellish extent,
When my heart stops beating,
Will it all be in vain?,
It burns a little faith every time it'll fall,
Looking for reconciliation with the years that I've lost,
When my heart stops beating, will I still feel the same?.

Chorus:
I've been falling for miles down for a while,
And back again,
It's only calm for a while now in the eye of the hurricane,
I only wanna feel safe,
Can't dig my heels in the ground,
I only wanna be free,
And make my family proud,
And I hope I figure it out.

Verse 2:
Getting used to prying eyes to my faith I resign,
Guess it's the classic roll of pay for trying to step out of line,
If it all starts crumbling, well the blame is all mine.

Chorus:
I've been falling for miles down for a while,
And back again,
It's only calm for a while now in the eye of the hurricane,

Heard that you're moving on and I shoulda guessed,

Song title is Someone You Loved (Martin Garrix Remix) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me,
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy,
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know,
Somebody to have, somebody to hold,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain.

Chorus:
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall,
And you're not here to get me through it all,
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug,
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

Post-Chorus:
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

Drop:
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved,
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

Verse 2:
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to,
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you,
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal,
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape,

Song title is Someone Like You by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I heard that you settled down,
That you found a girl and you're married now,
I heard that your dreams came true,
Guess she gave you things I couldn't give to you,
Old friend, why are you so shy?,
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

Pre-Chorus:
I'd hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited,
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it,
I'd hoped you'd see my face,
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over.

Chorus:
Never mind, I'll find someone like you,
I wish nothing but the best for you,
Don't forget me, I beg,
I'll remember, you said,
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.

Counting days, counting days,
Since my love up and got lost on me,
And every breath that I've been taken,

That you'll come back when you can find some peace,

Since you left feels like a hollow street.

But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind,

Chase my thoughts,
While staring at the bedroom door,

They still serve as a reminder of all the bruises that we ain't had yet.

Hope you'll be holding onto my last breath,
The truth's in everything we never said,

But girl you don't look any older to me.

Song title is Before You Go (Piano Version) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I fell by the wayside like everyone else,
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself,
Our every moment, I start to replace,
'Cause now that they’re gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say.

Pre-Chorus:
When you hurt under the surface,
Like troubled water running cold,
Well, time can heal but this won't.

Chorus:
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To make your heart beat better?,
If only I’d have known you had a storm to weather,
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To make it all stop hurting?,
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless,
So, before you go.

Verse 2:
Was never the right time, whenever you called,
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all,
Our every moment, I start to replay,
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face,

Would we be better off by now,
If I'd have let my walls come down?,

Song title is Tough (Acoustic) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece of you,
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew,
Is holding onto you,
And every waking hour I spend,
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed,
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead,
If every hope of you is dead.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause every night since you cut and run,
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one,
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking,
With every step that you're taking.

Chorus:
'Cause you've been running circles 'round,
My mind, turning me inside out,
And I fell for you but hit the ground,
'Cause the only love I've known has let me,
Down and I need lifting up,
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough,
And I'm praying I can pray enough,
So waking up without you ain’t so tough.

Verse 2:
Find it hard to find my feet,
When I keep on stumbling over you and me,
But I keep on trying 'cause I know I need,
To outrun the memories,

 Verse 1:
Cold blood,
She said call it what you want,
She got her fists out,
Now that she's bored of making love,
Undone,
I hear her calling as I come,
But I ain't got no lord,
No hope in hell could call me out.

Pre-Chorus:
I know you're tired of taking time off my hands,
But I can't help hoping you'll still wait on my bed.

Chorus:
Oh you, stuck to me like glue,
My heart sees you around the room,
How do you do the things you do?,
Take my heart; I don't need it.

Verse 2:
I'm tired, I let you put me in my place,
Lately I stay by the line,
Just to be standing in your way.

Pre-Chorus:
I know you're tired of taking time off my hands,

How do you do the things you do?,

Song title is Without Me (SiriusXM) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Found you when your heart was broke,
I filled your cup until it overflowed,
Took it so far to keep you close,
I was afraid to leave you on your own.

Pre-Chorus:
Said I'd catch you if you fall,
And if they laugh, then fuck ’em all,
Then I got you off your knees,
Put you right back on your feet,
Just so you could take advantage of me.

Chorus:
Tell me how it feels sittin' up there,
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me,
You know I’m the one who put you up there,
Name in skies, ever get lonely?,
Thinking you could live without me,
Live without me,
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there,
Don't know why.

Verse 2:
Gave love 'bout a hundred times,
Just running from the demons in your mind,
Then I took yours and made 'em mine,
Still didn't notice 'cause my love was blind,

Song title is The Climb by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I can almost see it,
That dream I'm dreaming, but,
There's a voice inside my head saying,
You'll never reach it,
Every step I'm taking,
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction,
But my faith is fading.

Pre-Chorus 1:
'Cause I, I gotta keep trying,
Gotta keep my head held high.

Chorus:
There's always gonna be another mountain,
I'm always gonna wanna make it move,
It's always gonna be an uphill battle,
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose,
Ain’t about how fast I get there,
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side,
It's the climb.

Verse 2:
The struggles I'm facing,
These chances I'm taking,
Sometimes might knock me down, but,
I won't be breaking,
I may not know it,
But these are the moments that,
I'm gonna remember the most now,
I [?] going,

Song title is Forever (Live) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober,
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99,
Just like old times all over,
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever,
I really wish that I dressed up a little better,
No regrets is what we said,
We can't go back again.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.

Verse 2:
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table,
Wish you the best, I would if I was able,
Morning light, it stings a little,
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling,
Had too much tonic wine, sometimes, it does the talking,
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever,

Take those long summer days,
When love was untamed,
Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.


Song title is Before You Go (Guitar Acoustic) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I fell by the wayside like everyone else,
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself,
Our every moment, I start to replace,
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say.

Pre-Chorus:
When you hurt under the surface,
Like troubled water running cold,
Well, time can heal but this won't.

Chorus:
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To make your heart beat better?,
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather,
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To make it all stop hurting?,
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless,
So, before you go.

Verse 2:
Was never the right time, whenever you called,
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all,
Our every moment, I start to replay,
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face,

 Verse 1:
I will always remember,
The day you kissed my lips,
Light as a feather,
It went just like this,
No, it's never been better,
Than the summer of 2002,
We were only 11,
Acting like grown-ups,
Like we are in the present,
Drinking from plastic cups,
Singing, Love is forever and ever,
Well, I guess that was true.

Pre-Chorus:
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods,
Of an old Mustang, where we sang,
Songs with all our childhood friends,
And it went like this, say.

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye,

Song title is Someone You Loved (Nightcore Remix) by Lewis Capaldi:

  or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy,
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know,
Somebody to have, somebody to hold,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain.

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall,
And you're not here to get me through it all,
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug,
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to,
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you,
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal,
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape,
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall,
And you're not here to get me through it all,
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug,
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes,
I fall into your arms,

 drivers license LyricsVerse 1:
I got my driver's license last week,
Just like we always talked about,
'Cause you were so excited for me,
To finally drive up to your house,
And today I drove through the suburbs,
Crying 'cause you weren't around.

Verse 2:
And you're probably with that blonde girl,
Who always made me doubt,
She's so much older than me,
She's everything I'm insecure about,
But today, I drove through the suburbs,
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?.

Chorus:
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one,
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone,
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me,
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street.

Verse 3:
And all my friends are tired,
Of hearing how much I miss you, but,
I kinda feel sorry for them,
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do,

Counting days, counting days,
Since my love up and got lost on me,
And every breath that I've been taken,
Since you left feels like a waste on me,

That you'll come back when you can find some peace,
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken,
Since you left feels like a hollow street.

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind,
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind,

Close your eye, let's go to sleep,

I've been angry & sad about the things that you do,

You know that I'm not that strong.

One more look & I forget everything, whoa-oh-oh.

Cause I can't help falling in love with you,
Cause I can't help falling in love with you....


Song title is Forever (Live from Edinburgh) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober,
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99,
Just like old times all over,
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever,
I really wish that I dressed up a little better,
No regrets is what we said,
We can't go back again.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.

Verse 2:
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table,
Wish you the best, I would if I was able,
Morning light, it stings a little,
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling,
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking,
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever,

Chorus:
Nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, they'll never,
Take those long summer days,
When love was untamed,
Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.


Song title is How I’m Feeling Now (Orchestral Version) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Will you forgive me if I'm comin' off a little bit obtuse?,
Well, it's been a minute now since I have had to tell the truth,
I know I can,
I won't.

Verse 2:
Suppose I thought that, by this moment, I would have it figured out,
But, instead, I tend to spend my days consumed by seeds of doubt,
I know I can,
I won't.

Pre-Chorus:
Oh, darlin', it goes on and on and on,
Always, forever, 'til I'm barely holdin' on,
End of my tether and I know it won't be long,
It won't be long 'til it's gone.

That seems to leave me so unsatisfied,
No sense of self, but self-obsessed,
I'm always trapped inside my fuckin' head.

Song title is Tough (Madism Remix) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Intro:
Tough,
Tough.

Verse 1:
Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece of you,
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew,
Is holding onto you,
And every waking hour I spend,
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed,
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead,
If every hope of you is dead.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause every night since you cut and run,
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one,
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking,
With every step that you're taking.

Chorus:
'Cause you've been running circles 'round,
My mind, turning me inside out,
And I fell for you but hit the ground,
'Cause the only love I've known has let me,
Down and I need lifting up,
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough,
And I'm praying I can pray enough,
So waking up without you ain’t so tough,

Find it hard to find my feet,
When I keep on stumbling over you and me,
But I keep on trying 'cause I know I need,
To outrun the memories.

Pre-Chorus:
And every day I'm reminded of,
The way I let it come undone,
I feel like the lonely one, the only one with time worth wasting,
Well, I still can't stop chasing.

Chorus:
'Cause you've been running circles 'round,
My mind, turning me inside out,
And I fell for you but hit the ground,
'Cause the only love I've known has let me,
Down and I need lifting up,

And I'm praying I can pray enough,

Song title is Falling To Pieces by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse I:
So tell me now who could've known,
Four years have past since you moved on,
Sometimes I still wait by the door,
But I know this ain't your home no more.

Pre-Chorus:
Searching for something to do,
To bring me closer to you,
I'm doing anything and everything but I can't get through,
Looking for something to say,
To keep the demons at bay,
The only remedy’s a melody that we can replay.

Chorus:
For every line I hear you sing to me,
I make a promise that I'll try to keep,
Those London crowds sound just like symphonies,
But I can't believe it,

Sometimes we're left without a choice,
Just know I long to hear your voice,

Song title is Someone You Loved (Live from The BRIT Awards, London 2020) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me,
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy,
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know,
Somebody to have, somebody to hold,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain.

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall,
And you're not here to get me through it all,
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug,
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to,
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you,

It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape.

Song title is Cry by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I didn't see the pieces falling apart,
Completely added and think you'd leave me down, here.

From all toughts of yours. Oh mine though caught in the hands,
With time no i didn't think it would be fine, no,
The music was playing, but we couldn't face it. It's trying to pretend nothing's wrong,
And you never told me, you were burning slowley, but you know I knew all along.


Chorus:
So I never took the time to say,
Everything you ment to me,
I just can't belive that you're not here,
And everything i showеd of us,
Now I never get thе chance,
I just can't belive that you're not here,
'Cause I had the best when I had you,
And now that you're gone, all that I do,
Is cry.

Song title is I Wish You The Best (magyar dalszöveg) by Lewis Capaldi:
    1 ContributorI Wish You The Best (magyar dalszöveg) LyricsHiá,

 ányzik, hogy nem tudom, mire gondolsz,
Hallgatni, hogy milyen volt a napod,
El tudnád mesélni úgy, kedvesem,
Hogy őt ki hagyod belőle?,
Mostanra már valószínűleg az óceán másik felén vagy,
Miközben én még mindig az esőben ázok,
Minden eltelt nappal, mióta utoljára beszéltünk,
Olyan, mintha Glasgow egyre távolabb kerülne LA-től.

Talán így van ez rendjén.

De, oh, drágám,
Szeretném kimondani: Hiányzik gyönyörű szép zöld szemed,
És amikor azt mondtam, maradjunk barátok, lehet hazudtam,
Szeretném kimondani: Bárcsak sosem hagytál volna el,
De helyette csak a legjobbakat kívánom neked,
Szeretném kimondani: Nélküled minden rossz,
És, hogy te voltál minden, amire szükségem volt,
Szeretném kimondani: Bárcsak sosem hagytál volna el,
De helyette csak a legjobbakat kívánom neked.

Nem tudom nem észrevenni,
Hogy most boldogabbnak tűnsz, mint velem voltál,
És talán azt kellene mondanom, hogy sajnálom,
Úgy tűnik, én voltam a probléma egész végig,
You might also likeTalán csak lehúztalak.

De helyette csak a legjobbakat kívánom neked,
Szeretném kimondani: Nélküled minden rossz,

De helyette csak a legjobbakat kívánom neked.

De, oh, drágám,
Oh, woah,
Oh, drágám,
Oh, woah.

Bárcsak tudnék olyat mondani, amit komolyan gondolok,
De boldognak akarlak látni téged, akár velem vagy, akár nélkülem,
Szeretném kimondani: Bárcsak sosem hagytál volna el,
De helyette csak a legjobbakat kívánom neked,
Szeretném kimondani: Nélküled minden rossz,

Song title is Burning (Orchestral Version) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Can't even begin to explain,
This all too well familiar pain,
It comes and it goes,
But it gets in my bones all the same, ooh-ooh.

Pre-Chorus:
Well, maybe I'm a fool,
For falling in love with you,
When I had nothing left to lose,
And nothing more I could give,
Went down with your sinking ship,
Now I don't think I'll make it through,
Through.

Chorus:
Now it's only the beat of my heart,
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks,
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya,
Keep ya,
Keep ya from burning alone,
'Cause, the longer you convince me to stay,
Our salvation's slipping further away,
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya,
Keep ya,
Keep ya from burning alone,

Forget everything we've come to expect,
It only serves to further fuck with our heads,
And I don't wanna pretend,

We could put this to bed for good,
Can call it quits or risk sinking with this broken ship,
But I don't think we'd make it through,
Through.

Chorus:
Now it's only the beat of my heart,
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks,
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya,
Keep ya,

Our salvation's slipping further away,
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya,
Keep ya,
Keep ya from burning alone.

Bridge:
I wish I could stay,
I wish I could lie,
Do whatever it takes to get you through the night,
I can't be the one,
I can't take the fall,
Can't go up in the flames to keep your body warm,
Chorus:
Now it's only the beat of my heart,
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks,
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya,
Keep ya,
Keep ya from burning alone,
'Cause, the longer you convince me to stay,
Our salvation's slipping further away,
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya,

Keep ya from burning alon.


Song title is Before You Go (Intryx Remix) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I fell by the wayside like everyone else,
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself,
Our every moment, I start to replace,
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say.

Pre-Chorus:
When you hurt under the surface,
Like troubled water running cold,
Well, time can heal but this won't.

Chorus:
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To makе your heart beat bettеr?,
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather,
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To make it all stop hurting?,
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless,
So, before you go.

Do you ever feel like goin' back?,
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find,
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind,
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart,
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?,
Oh, and you know I would if I could,
Maybe I spend more time in Hollywood than I should,
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart,
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?.


Song title is Before You Go (Live from Brixton Academy, London, 2019) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I fell by the wayside like everyone else,
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself,
Our every moment, I start to replace,
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say.

Pre-Chorus:
When you hurt under the surface,
Like troubled water running cold,
Well, time can heal but this won't.

Chorus:
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To make your heart beat better?,
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather,
So, before you go,
Was there something I could've said,
To make it all stop hurting?,
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless,
So, before you go.

Verse 2:
Was never the right time, whenever you called,
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all,
Our every moment, I start to replay,
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face,

Days ache and nights are long,
Two years and still you're not gone,
Guess I'm still holding on,
Drag my name through the dirt,
Somehow it doesn't hurt though,
Guess you're still holding on,
You told your friends you want me dead,
And said that I did everything wrong,
And you're not wrong.

Well, I'll take all the vitriol,
But not the thought of you moving on.

Song title is Pointless (Piano Acoustic) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I bring her coffee in the mornin',
She brings me inner peace,

I make her cards on her birthday,
She makes me a better man,
I take her water when she's thirsty,
She takes me as I am.

I love it when her mind wanders,
And she loves it when I stay at home,
I know when she's lost,
And she knows when I feel alone.

Everything is pointless without you,
Of all the dreams I'm chasing,

And she lights up the room,

Song title is Someone You Loved (Live From Wembley) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me,
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy,
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know,
Somebody to have, somebody to hold,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain.

Chorus:
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall,
And you're not here to get me through it all,
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug,
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.

Verse 2:
I'm going undеr, and this time, I fear therе's no one to turn to,
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you,

Somebody to have, just to know how it feels,
It's easy to say, but it's never the same,
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape.

Long hours and a few dyin' flowers,
But you never seem to stick around,
How could you let somethin' so good,
Go to waste and bleed the colours out?.

Pre-Chorus:
You don't know what you got till it's gone,
Know when it's right till it's wrong,
In search of perfect when you had it with you all along,
You broke her heart down with ease,
Now I'm pickin' up every piece,
You must be so hard to please.

Chorus:
I wish I could say,
Thank you for all the mistakes,
Thank you for all of the pain,
I guess somebody else's loss is another's gain,
I'm sayin' thank you to the one who let her get away,
Away.

Song title is Forever (Live From Wembley) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober,
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99,
Just like old times all over,
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever,
I really wish that I dressed up a little better,
No regrets is what we said,
We can't go back again.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.

Verse 2:
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table,
Wish you the best, I would if I was able,
Morning light, it stings a little,
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling,
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking,
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for.

Chorus:
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever,
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there,
I never said that we would die together,
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever,

Take those long summer days,
When love was untamed,
Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember,
Nobody said that it would last forever.

Pray silence, I'm begging,
Too tired to tell you I ain’t coming home,

And I ain't responsible for the lump in your throat.

Haven’t you had enough of loneliness?.

Since my love up and got lost on me,
And every breath that I've been taking,

Since you left feels like a hollow street.

Song title is Fade (Live From Wembley) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
It ain't no wonder why we lose control,
When we're always a heart attack away from falling in love,
Well, I know that we've been hardly holding on,
To tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far,
Running near on empty,
I wish somebody would've told me.

Chorus:
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons,
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray,
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me,
Girl, you make my heart break more every day,
But don't fade away.

Verse 2:
And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all,
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs,
And now it's so hard to breathe,
I wish somebody would've told me.

Chorus:
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons,
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray,

Song title is Pointless (Strings Acoustic) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I bring her coffee in the mornin',
She brings me inner peace,
I take her out to fancy restaurants,
She takes the sadness out of me,
I make her cards on her birthday,
She makes me a better man,
I take her water when she's thirsty,
She takes me as I am.

And she loves it when I stay at home,
I know when she's lost,
And she knows when I feel alone.

Everything is pointless without you,

And she lights up the room,

Song title is Maybe (Live From Wembley) by Lewis Capaldi:

 Verse 1:
I've said a thousand things before,
I've fallen in and out of love,
I couldn't walk but tried to run,
At night, the weight of expectation seems to keep me up,
A thousand times, I said too much,
Always second-guess before I jump,
I gave my all, but not enough,
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough.

Pre-Chorus:
How come I'm the only one who ever seems to get in my way?,
Lately, I've been fucking up a good thing any chance I can get.

Chorus:
Somebody to lean on, somebody to hold,
It's just another to lead, though, before I let go,
And I ain't trying to bе lonely, solely,
But evеrything I touch turns to stone,
Maybe I'm better off on my own.

Verse 2:
A thousand times, I've heard the same,
I've heard some other voices in my head,
Let me assure you that my mind's in check,
I just can't put my faith in something we might live to regret,

 Verse 1:
Salt of the earth, my friend,
It's all that we are in the end,
Well, you trapped down all the lines you drew,
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry, I don't want the bruise,
Your voice gets a little loud,
When there's nothing to talk about, you shout, dear.

And I'll find my lights fading out,
More and more by the hour,
It gets dark in here.

Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me.

Dust to dust, my friend,
Wеll, you're only blood and bones,
And I know your heart's at war with your hеad,
I am sure it hurt to see,
You're more than I'll ever have,
And more than I'll ever be,
I know it's a little late,
My timing was never great,
But I'm calling, dear,

I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet,
Until you opened your mouth,
And you said you loved.

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes,

And I can't wait to go home.

Packed up the photo album Matthew had made,

Poured the old ginger beer down the sink,

 Song title is   Galway Girl by Ed Sheeran:
Chorus:
She played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said, Baby, I just wanna dance.

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar,
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar,
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?,
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?,
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun,
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun,
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar,
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance.

Chorus:
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said, Baby, I just wanna dance,
With my pretty little Galway Girl,
You're my pretty little Galway Girl.

Verse 2:
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool,
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room,
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool,
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes,
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet,
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat,
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week,
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me,

Verse 3:
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time,
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine,
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine,
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night,
I walked her home then she took me inside,
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine,
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write,
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night.

 Song title is   Photograph by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes,
But it's the only thing that I know,
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes,
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.

We keep this love in a photograph,
We made these memories for ourselves,
Where our eyes are never closing,
Hearts are never broken,
And time's forever frozen, still.

Chorus:
So you can keep me,
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans,
Holding me closer till our eyes meet,
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home.

Verse 2:
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul,
And it's the only thing that I know, know,
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya,
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.

Under the lamppost back on 6th Street,
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
Wait for me to come home,

Oh, just a little bit wrong,
Baby, I apologize for it.

 Song title is   Don’t by Ed Sheeran:
    I met this girl late last year,
    She said, ,
Verse 1:
I met this girl late last year,
She said, Don't you worry if I disappear,
I told her, I'm not really looking for another mistake,
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait,
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned,
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn,
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right,
I went away for months until our paths crossed again,
She told me, I was never looking for a friend,
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin,
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM,
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin',
Chorus:
Don't **** with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that, babe,
Don't **** with my love,
I told her, she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that, babe,
You might also likeVerse 2:
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her,
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza,
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her,
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her,
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature,
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either,
But me and her, we make money the same way,
Four cities, two planes, the same day,
And those shows have never been what it's about,
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out,
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch,
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now,
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out,
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about,
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing,
Chorus:
Don't **** with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that, babe,
Don't **** with my love,
I told her, she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that, babe,
Verse 3:
On my hotel door,
I don't even know if she knows what for,
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya,
Trust and respect is what we do this for,
I never intended to be next (Get lost),
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all,
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost),
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course,
It's not like we were both on tour,
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor,
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment,
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different,
This is not the way you realised what you wanted,
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest,
And all this time, God knows I'm singin',
Chorus:
Don't **** with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that, babe,
Don't **** with my love,

Ooh, ooh.

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control,
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes,
And tonight had something wonderful.

Conversations with a stranger I barely know,
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't,
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do,
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space,
And I know I lose control of the things that I say,

 Song title is   The A Team by Ed Sheeran:

White lips, pale face,
Breathin' in the snowflakes,
Burnt lungs, sour taste,
Light's gone, days end,
Struggling to pay rent,
Long nights, strange men.

Pre-Chorus:
And they say,
She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since 18,
But lately, her face seems,
Slowly sinking, wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
The worst things in life come free to us.

Chorus:
'Cause we're just under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple grams,
And she don't wanna go outside tonight,
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland,

For angels to fly,

Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls,
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
Keep watching over Durin's sons.

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together,
Watch the flames climb high into the night,

 Song title is   Eraser by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind,
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine,
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride,
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind,
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life,
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride,
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive,
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride,
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs,
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun,
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up,
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become,
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me,
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree,
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry,
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key,
And you'll see.

Pre-Chorus:
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me,
But with that said, give me one more.

Chorus:
Another one to take the sting away,
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day,
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,
You might also likeVerse 2:
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs,
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong,
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell,
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well,
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps,
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun,
Please know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run,
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become,
Have conversations with my father on the A14,
Age twelve, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams,
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me,
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans,
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou',
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud,
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed,
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now,
Somehow.

Pre-Chorus:
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me,
But with that said, give me one more.

Chorus:
Another one to take the sting away,
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day,
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,
Post-Chorus:
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.

Bridge:
Welcome to the new show,
I guess you know I've been away,
But where I'm heading, who knows?,
But my heart will stay the same,
Welcome to the new show,
I guess you know I've been away,
But where I'm heading, who knows?,
My pain eraser.

Outro:
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser,
 

 Song title is   Remember the Name by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
Yeah, I was born a misfit,
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich,
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence,
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick,
Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas,
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin',
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list,
Might be insanity, but people call it gifted,
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with,
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted,
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick,
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business,
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em,
20 years old is when I came in the game,
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name,
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today,
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great,
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware,
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked,
You know I want way more than I already got,
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent:
You know it ain't my time to call it a day,
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid,
But it's 'bout time you remember the name,
Ayy, ayy,
You know it ain't my time to call it a day,
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid,
But it's 'bout time you remember the name,
Ayy, ayy,
(Hey, hey, hey),

I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh),
From Taco Bell to TRL,

As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict,

But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?),
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?),
In my eyelids now (What?),
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah),
Without a doubt, by any means,
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em,
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes,
Which really means, no if, ands, or buts are squeezin' in between,
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams,
Not even when I'm on my deathbed,
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet,
So why would I quit?,
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead,
Just popped in my head,
I said it, then forgot what I said.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem:
It isn't my time to call it a day,
I got rap locked and I'm already paid,
But it's 'bout time you remember the name,
Ayy, ayy,
You know it ain't my time to call it a day,
I got rap locked and I'm already paid,
But it's 'bout time you remember the name,
Ayy, ayy,
Verse 3: 50 Cent:
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean,
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip,
Man, you know just what I mean,
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it,
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?,
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin',
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em,
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit,
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?,
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles,
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow,
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit,
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit,
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober,
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 50 Cent:
You know it ain't my time to call it a day,
I got rap locked and I'm already paid,
And it's about time you remember the name,
Ayy, ayy,
You know it ain't my time to call it a day,
I got rap locked and I'm already paid,
But it's 'bout time you remember the name,
Ayy, ayy,

 Song title is   Afterglow by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
(One, two).

Verse 1:
Stop the clocks, it's amazing,
You should see the way the light dances off your hair,
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red,
Saturday morning is fading,
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand,
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again.

Pre-Chorus:
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle,
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow,
So alone in love like the world had disappeared,
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go,
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow,
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears.

Chorus:
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow,
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow.

Verse 2:
The weather outside's changing,
The leaves are buried under six inches of white,
The radio is playing Iron & Wine,
This is a new dimension,
This is a level where we're losing track of time,
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I,

    NaSong title is  na-na-na
Intro:
Na-na-na-na-na.

Verse 1:
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans,
Goes to the gym at least six times a week,
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet,
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats,
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached,
Owns every single Ministry CD,
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means,
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me,
But still, I'm just keepin' it real,
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil',
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back,
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at,
Let me remind you of the days when,
You used to hold my hand,
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans,
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman,
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved,
So let me give it to ya.

Chorus:
I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to,
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,
I don't wanna know about your new man,
We'll get there eventually,
I know you're missin' all this kind of love,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb,
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse,
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas,
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous,
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime,
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign,
Says Chune, bwoydem light up the room!,
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you,
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin',
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin',
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym,
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim,
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him,
Okay, you need to be alone,
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone,
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know,
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved,
So let me give it to ya.

Chorus:
I don't wanna know about your new man,

Bridge:
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week,
But you act so differently,
When you're with him, I know you're lonely,
Please remember you're still free,
To make the choice and leave,
Don't call me up, you need to show me.

Chorus:
I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to,

 Song title is   Nancy Mulligan by Ed Sheeran:
    I was twenty-,
Verse 1:
I was twenty-four years old,
When I met the woman I would call my own,
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old,
In that house that your brother bought ya,
On the summer day when I proposed,
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold,
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, No,
You can't marry my daughter.

Chorus:
She and I went on the run,
Don't care about religion,
I'm gonna marry the woman I love,
Down by the Wexford border,
She was Nancy Mulligan,
And I was William Sheeran,
She took my name and then we were one,
Down by the Wexford border.

Verse 2:
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War,
And she was working on a soldier's ward,
Never had I seen such beauty before,
The moment that I saw her,
Nancy was my yellow rose,
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes,
We got eight children now growing old,
Five sons and three daughters,

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair,
Over sixty years I've been loving her,
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs,
You know Nancy, I adore ya,
From a farm boy born near Belfast town,
I never worried 'bout the king and crown,
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground,
There's no difference, I assure ya.

Making me feel like the beat and the bassline,

Get lost in the rhythm of me,
Place don't close until we wanna leave it.

 Song title is   You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live at The Live Room) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd,
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud,
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush,
I’ll say the words that make you blush,
I’m gonna sing this now,
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue I stick to other artists,
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures,
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me,
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy,
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey.

Chorus:
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,

I sing, I write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell,
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell,
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing,
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing,
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school,
I came fast with the way I act, right,
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe,
And I won’t be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia,
Musically I’m demonstrating,
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating,
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me,
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah.

Chorus:
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,

Verse 3:
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it,
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music,
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?,
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me,
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely,
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?,
Hey, so I keep singing that,
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters,
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar,
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark,
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody,
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block,
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?,
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy,
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die,
So see the signs, stand to the side,
Open your eyes and take a look and realize,
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears,
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar,
Urban Angel rising from the ashes,
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady.

Pre-Chorus:
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub,
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex, I ain't into making love,
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly,
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex, I ain't into making love,
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,
Chorus:
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,

You need me, man, I don’t need you,

My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning,
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning,
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade,
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning.

Verse 4:
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit,
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it,
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic,
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit,
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood,
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should,
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good,
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel,
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug,
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug,
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged,
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above,
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub,
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love,
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine,
I blaze high grade weed all the time!.

Bridge:
Now my eyes are red,

Woooah,
Yea.

Verse 5:
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right,
I won't stop until my name's in lights,
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice,
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights,
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice,
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper,
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah,
The game's over but now I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal,
People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows but,
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch,
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out,
Wow, from day one I've been prepared,
With V05 wax for my ginger hair,
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of,
What the future holds cause it's another day.

Verse 6:
Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows,
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know,
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant,
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate,
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin,
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in,
Do it for the hell of it,
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit,
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image,
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick,
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses,
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this,
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative,
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is,
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is,
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing,
I'm back to sing this.

Chorus:
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me, man.

Verse 7:
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic,
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it,
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Into another rapper shoes using new laces,
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers,
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors,
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache,
I hit back, when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though,
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos,
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio,
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio,
Melody music maker, reading all the papers,
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator.

Chorus:
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me man,
Don't need yu.

 Song title is   Shivers by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I took an arrow to the heart,
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours,
Strawberries and then somethin' more,
Ooh, yeah, I want it all,
Lipstick on my guitar,
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far,
Go dancin' underneath the stars,
Ooh, yeah, I want it all,
Mmm, you got me feelin' like.

Pre-Chorus:
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes,
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm,
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night,
Yeah, you got me singin' like.

Chorus:
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that,
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers,
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks,
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back,
And we'll say, Ooh, I love it when you do it like that,
And when you're close up, give me the shivers,
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks,
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back,
Verse 2:
Into the car,
On the backseat in the moonlit dark,
Wrap me up between your legs and arms,
Ooh, I can't get enough,
You know you could tear me apart,

 Song title is   You Need Me, I Don’t Need You by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
I don't want bruise your ears,
Or hurt you again,
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab,
When I needed a friend.

Verse 1:
Now, I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd,
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud,
And I can't, no, I won't hush,
I'll say the words that make you blush,
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh),
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists,
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures,
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me,
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy,
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me.

Chorus:
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me,

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell,
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell,
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin',
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin',
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School,
I came fast with the way I act, right,
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe,
And I won't be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia,
And musically, I'm demonstratin',
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating,
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me,
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi.

Chorus:
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me,
Verse 3:
'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right,
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights at stadium heights, with Damien Rice,
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights,
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice,
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper,
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah,
The game's over but now, I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal,
People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows, but,
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch,
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out,
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared,
With V05 wax for my ginger hair,
So now, I'm back to the sofa givin' a dose of,
What the future holds 'cause it's another day,
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic,
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it,
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces,
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers,
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors,
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache,
I hit back when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though,
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos,
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio,
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio,
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers,
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator,
Chorus:
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,

And swap it for yours,

 Song title is   Visiting Hours by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours,
So I could just show up and bring the news,
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her,
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you.

Chorus:
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?,
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine,
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day,
So much has changed since you've been away.

Verse 2:
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours,
So I could just swing by and ask your advice,
What would you do in my situation?,
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them,
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right.

Chorus:
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?,
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure,
You'd say, Remember that the answer's in the love that we create,
So much has changed since you've been away.

Verse 3:
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours,
And I would ask them if I could take you home,
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best,
So I will live life the way you taught me,
And make it on my own,

My daddy told me, Son, don't you get involved in,
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels.

I know when I have children, they will know what it means,
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me,
Just love and understandin', positivity.

Chorus:
We could change this whole world with a piano,
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go,
I'm just a boy with a one-man show,
No university, no degree, but Lord knows,
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth,
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios,
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote,
Sayin' love could change the world in a moment,
But what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment,
But what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment,

Drinkin' fast, and then we talk slow (Mm),
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me,
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm),
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox,
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like.

Your love was handmade for somebody like me,

And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face,
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake,
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for,
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?,
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?,
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk,
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack,
And when you finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back,
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps,
And I got money in the bank, but not a figure like that,
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won,

 Song title is   Tenerife Sea by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
You look so wonderful in your dress,
I love your hair like that,
The way it falls on the side of your neck,
Down your shoulders and back,
We are surrounded by all of these lies,
And people who talk too much,
You got the kind of look in your eyes,
As if no one knows anything but us.

Should this be the last thing I see?,
I want you to know it's enough for me,
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need.

I'm so in love.

You look so beautiful in this light,
Your silhouette over me,

Is the Tenerife sea,
And all of the voices surrounding us here,
They just fade out when you take a breath,
Just say the word and I will disappear,
Into the wilderness,

 Song title is   Save Myself by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe,
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak,
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?,
Oh, honestly?,
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon,
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm,
They gave me the heartache and, in return, I gave a song,
It goes on and on.

Chorus:
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf,
No farewell,
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself.

Verse 2:
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain,
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain,
What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same,
And only scars remain.

Chorus:
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf,
No farewell,
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself,

Between the devil and the danger, but I guess it's just my nature,
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum,
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song,
But it helps,
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself.

Chorus:
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf,
No farewell,
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself.

Outro:
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself,
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself,
 

 Song title is   Hearts Don’t Break Around Here by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
She is the sweetest thing that I know,
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low,
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time,
Took my heart upon a one way trip,
Guess she went wandering off with it,
And unlike most women I know,
This one will bring it back whole.

Pre-Chorus:
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead,
Oh, my baby, lately I know.

Chorus:
That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear,
Oh, we're in love, aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs, baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah.

Verse 2:
She is the river flow in Orwell,
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah,
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs,
Spend my summertime beside her,
And the rest of the year, the same,
She is the flint that sparks the lighter,
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh,

Bridge:
Well, I found love hidden inside,
The arms of a woman I know,
She is the lighthouse in the night,
That will safely guide me home,
And I'm not scared of passing over,
Or the thought of growing old,
'Cause from now until I go.

Chorus:
Every night I’ll kiss you, you'll say in my ear,
Oh, we're in love, aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs, baby,

Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh, yeah, yeah,

You know hearts don't break around here,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
You know hearts don't break around here,

 Song title is   Bibia Be Ye Ye by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
Bibia be ye ye.

Verse 1:
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys,
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree,
I bet my mother's proud of me,
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee,
And all I know,
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat,
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain,
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again,
And tomorrow's a brand new day.

Chorus:
Someone told me, Always say what's on your mind,
And I am only being honest with you, I,
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time,
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye.

Post-Chorus:
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye,
Bibia be ye ye.

Verse 2:
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret,
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met,
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams,
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now,
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree,
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon,
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground,
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day,

Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end,

Going through the motions, going through us.

And all of my hopes, all of my words,
Are all over written on the signs,
When you're on my road walkin' me home,
Home, home, home, home.

 Song title is   Sing by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
It's late in the evening,
Glass on the side,
I've been sat with you,
For most of the night,
Ignorin' everybody here,
We wish they would disappear,
So maybe we could get down now,
I don't wanna know,
If you're gettin' ahead of the program,
I want you to be mine, lady,
To hold your body close,
Take another step into the no-man's land,
And for the longest time, lady.

I need you, darling,

Verse 2:
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage,
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days,
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know,
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke,
Let it go until our roads are changed,
Singin' We Found Love in a local rave,
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say,
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray,
I told her my name, then said It's nice to meet you,
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila,
I already know if she's a keeper,
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in,
Deep **** if anybody finds out,
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now,
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch,
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth,

 Song title is   Take Me Back to London by Ed Sheeran:
Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy:
Jet plane headed up to the sky,
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high,
We ain't hit a rave in a while,
So take me back to London (Yo).

Verse 1: Stormzy:
I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged),
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned),
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs),
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?),
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip,
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand),
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam),
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram,
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef,
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek,
I bought an AP to help me time keep,
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak,
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy),
Leave you wet like you scuba dived,
We were younger then and now we're unified,
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone.

Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy:
It's that time,
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime,
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing,
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes,
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy,
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint,
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub,
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I,
But that's my fault (Oh),
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh),
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh),
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah),
He said, Teddy, never get off your high horse,
And never let 'em take your crown,
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles,
But I'm heading back to London town right now,

Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop),
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while),
So take me back to London,
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low),
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome),
No town does it quite like my home,
So take me back to London.

Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran:
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine,
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime,
And this ain't like any top ten of mine,
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time,
And that's stadiums, man are aliens,
I drink supermalts and Vibranium,
I got an RM11 titanium,
And I rock a 5970 daily, but,
I want soul, I want flows,
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes,
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone,
And Ted said, That's just the way things go,
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows,
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both,
Took this sound that was made in Bow,
Went global, man, now the case is closed,
2015 in a Badingham pub,
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up,
And you'll go through tears with the people you love,
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough,
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop),
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot),
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone,
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home,
Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy:
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky),
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high),
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while),
So take me back to London,
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low),
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome),
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home),
So take me back to London,
So take me back to London,

 Song title is   Afire Love by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Things were all good yesterday,
And then the devil took your memory,
And if you fell to your death today,
I hope that Heaven is your resting place,
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain,
But then that could've been the medicine,
And now you're lyin' in the bed again,
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them.

Pre-Chorus:
And my father told me, Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one,
Although my grandma used to say,
That he used to sing.

Chorus:
Darlin', hold me in your,
Arms the way you did last night,
And we'll lie inside,
For a little while here, oh,
I could look into your eyes,
Until the sun comes up,
And we're wrapped in light,
And life and love,
Put your open lips on mine,
And slowly let them shut,
For they're designed,
To be together, oh,
With your body next to mine,
Our hearts will beat as one,
And we're set alight,
We're afire love,
Oh, love,

Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen,
Six years old, I remember when.

 Song title is   U.N.I. by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor,
The only evidence that you'd been here before,
And I don't get waves of missin' you anymore,
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes,
Never gettin' dry, so I get high,
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on,
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye,
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night,
I don't drink like everybody else,
I do it to forget things about myself,
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got,
My mind's with you but my heart's just not.

Pre-Chorus:
So am I close to you anymore if it's over,
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?.

Chorus:
That's why you and I,
Ended over U-N-I,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,
You and I,
Ended over U-N-I,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,

Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that,
I never wanna settle down, come around,
Break up the love like LEGO now,
Never wanna turn into another like you,
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views,
Everything's great, not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus,
Now, I'm in a position to be another stalker,
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward,
Like our last kiss, it was perfect,
We were nervous on the surface,
And I'm always saying every day that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts,
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative,
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss.

Pre-Chorus:
So am I close to you anymore if it's over,
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?.

Chorus:
Oh, you and I,
Ended over U-N-I,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,

And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,
Bridge:
Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now,
And maybe I can let myself down (Wo-oah),
And I'm thinkin' I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground,
Keep lookin' around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low,
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered,
From all that I've done wrong,
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one,
But I know God made another one of me,
To love you better than I ever will.

Chorus:
'Cause you and I,
Ended over U-N-I,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,
You and I,
Ended over U-N-I,

 Song title is   Take It Back by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow,
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know,
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in,
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden,
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision,
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism,
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen,
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven,
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager,
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather,
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after,
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter,
For four years I never had a place to stay,
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight,
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home,
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked,
And went from sleeping at a subway station,
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population,
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax,
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now.

Hook:
Mmm, come on and take it back, love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back, love,
No,

I take it back with the rhythm and blues,
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news,
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school,
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth,
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit,
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm,
Whispering, Everything that happens is from now on,
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song,
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong,
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME,
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree,
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids,
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic,
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it,
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now.

Hook:
Mmm, come on and take it back, love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back, love,
No, I'll take it back now,
Verse 3:
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect,
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless,
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed,
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus,
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton,
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless,
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition,
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written,
Now absence can make your heart ache,
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state,
Vividly, need to let my liver be,
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends,
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me,
And I hope to see him blowing up globally,
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally,
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but,
But I just write schemes,
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans,
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely,
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates,
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made,
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray,
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down,
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now,
Hook:
Mmm, come on and take it back, love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back, love,
No,
Mmm, come on and take it back, love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back, love,
No.

Verse 4:
My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme,
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?,
With this you must know that the numbers just sold,
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me,
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake,
But the other 10 percent, it never fades,
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads,
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade,
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more,
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought,
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors,
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour,
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit,
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick,
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss,
And most of these other guys are kids that pose,
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is,
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it,
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower,
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow,
Igh!,

My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy),
Leave you wet like you scuba dived,
We were younger then and now we're unified,
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone.

Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy:
It's that time,
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime,
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing,
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes,
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy,
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint,
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub,
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I,
But that's my fault  (Oh),
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh),
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh),
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Whoa),
He said, Teddy, never get off your high horse,
And never let 'em take your crown,
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles,
But I'm heading back to London town right now,

Jaykae, make a lot of P (Uh),
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be,
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G,
5 million minimum, what I wanna see,

Tell mumsy that I'm on a track with Ed,
Aim this one at your head,
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead,

Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome,
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home),

 Song title is   Best Part of Me by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
My lungs are black, my heart is pure,
My hands are scarred from nights before,
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places,
I am a little insecure,
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue,
I bite my nails and tell the truth,
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates,
My skin is inked, but faded too.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
But she loves me, she loves me,
Why the hell does she love me,
When she could have anyone else?,
Oh, you love me, you love me,
Why the hell do you love me?,
'Cause I don't even love myself.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran with YEBBA:
Baby, the best part of me is you,
And lately, everything's making sense too,
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you.

Verse 2: YEBBA:
I overthink and still forget,
I lose my phone and place my bets,
And I never catch the train on time,
Always thirty minutes behind,
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet,

 Song title is   Small Bump by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
You're just a small bump unborn,
In four months, you're brought to life,
You might be left with my hair,
But you'll have your mother's eyes,
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can,
But for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans,
A small bump, in four months, you're brought to life.

Pre-Chorus:
And I'll whisper quietly,
I'll give you nothin' but truth,
If you're not inside me,
I'll put my future in you.

Chorus:
You are my one and only,
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
Oh, you are my one and only,
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
And you'll be all right.

Verse 2:
Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin,
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin,
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice,
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide,
A small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes,

And you can lie with me,
With your tiny feet,
When you're half asleep,
I'll leave you be,
Right in front of me,
For a couple weeks,
So I can keep you safe.

Chorus:
'Cause you are my one and only,
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
Oh, you are my one and only,
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
And you'll be all right,
Outro:
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn,
For four months then torn from life,
Maybe you were needed up there,
But we're still unaware as why,
 

 Song title is   The Joker And The Queen by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
How was I to know? It's a crazy thing,
I showed you my hand and you still let me win,
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?,
The road that was broken brought us together.

Chorus:
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings,
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring,
When I fold, you see the best in me,
The joker and the queen.

I was upside down from the outside in,
You came to the table and you went all in,
With a single word and a gentle touch,
You turned a moment into forever.

And hearts that could give you a diamond ring,
When I fold, you see the best in me,
The joker and the queen.

 Song title is   Nina by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well,
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell,
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer,
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?,
Under the covers where we used to lay,
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played,
I'd be on tour almost every day,
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay,
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed,
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe,
We used each other's air just for the people to see,
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep,
We go anywhere our minds would take us,
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up,
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause,
We can all be loved the way that God made us,
And time's the only reason that we could break up,
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much,
Distance is relative to the time that it takes,
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again.

Chorus:
Oh, Nina,
You should go, Nina,
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina,
Oh, won't you leave me now?,
And I've been living on the road, Nina,
But then again, you should know, Nina,
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina,
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?,
You might also likeVerse 2:
And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie,
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold,
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own,
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone,
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits,
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish,
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics,
I disappear, you call me selfish,
I understand but I can’t help it,
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends,
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back,
Overlook the situation,
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications,
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break,
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late,
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane,
But in a day, we'll have to say it again.

Chorus:
Oh, Nina,
You should go, Nina,
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina,
Oh, won't you leave me now?,
And I've been living on the road, Nina,
But then again, you should know, Nina,
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina,
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?,
Bridge:
Love will come and love will go,
But you can't make it on your own,
Sing that song, go,

People grow and fall apart,
But you can't mend your broken heart,
Take it back, go,
Oh, won't you leave me now?.

 Song title is   Eyes Closed by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I know it's a bad idea,
But how can I help myself?,
Been inside for most this year,
And I thought a few drinks, they might help,
It's been a while, my dear,
Dealin' with the cards life dealt,
I'm still holdin' back these tears,
While my friends are somewhere else.

Pre-Chorus:
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February,
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?,
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat,
'Cause I'm here alonе.

Chorus:
Just dancin' with my eyes closed,
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you,
And time is movin' so slow,
And I don't know what else that I can do,
So I'll keep dancin' with my.

Post-Chorus:
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,

But I lost more than my friend,
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah).

Pre-Chorus:
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready,
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?,
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone,
And life just goes on.

Chorus:
So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed,

 Song title is   Wake Me Up by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I should ink my skin with your name,
And take my passport out again and just replace it,
See, I could do without a tan on my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle,
And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles,
'Cause maybe you're loveable,
And maybe you're my snowflake,
And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter,
I'll hold you in a cold place,
And you should never cut your hair,
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder.

Chorus:
And you will never know,
Just how beautiful you are to me,
But maybe I'm just in love,
When you wake me up.

Verse 2:
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?,
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?,
And I know you love Shrek, 'cause we've watched it 12 times,
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale, too,
And if your DVD breaks today, you should've got a VCR,
'Cause I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say,
And now I've always been shit at computer games,
And your brother always beats me,
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV,
And then you'd laugh at me, and be asking me,
If I'm gonna be home next week,
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep,
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets,

And you will never know,

Verse 3:
And I think you hate the smell of smoke,
You always try and get me to stop,
But you drink as much as me,
And I get drunk a lot,
So I’ll take you to the beach,
And walk along the sand,
And I'll make you a heart pendant,
With a pebble held in my hand,
And I'll carve it like a necklace,
So the heart falls where your chest is,
Now, a piece of me is a piece of the beach,
And it falls just where it needs to be,
And rests peacefully,
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now,
Against yours now.

Outro:
'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Oh, maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up,
 

 Song title is   All of the Stars by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon,
I saw a shooting star and thought of you,
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew,
If you were here, I'd sing to you,
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two,
I'm miles away from seeing you,
But I can see the stars from America,
I wondered, do you see them too?.

Chorus:
So open your eyes and see,
The way our horizons meet,
And all of the lights will lead,
Into the night with me,
And I know these scars will bleed,
But both of our hearts believe,
All of these stars will guide us home.

Verse 2:
I can hear your heart on the radio beat,
They're playing Chasing Cars and I thought of us,
Back to the time you were lying next to me,
I looked across and fell in love,
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew,
Everything led back to you,
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?,
You're the song my heart is beating to,

 Song title is   Overpass Graffiti by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
This is a dark parade,
Another rough patch to rain on,
To rain on,
I know your friends may say,
This is a cause for celebration,
Hip, hip, hooray, love.

Pre-Chorus:
Photographs in sepia tones,
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold,
Alone,
There are times when I can feel your ghost,
Just when I'm almost letting you go,
The cards were stacked against us both.

Chorus:
I will always love you for what it's worth,
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass,
And I know time may change the way you think of us,
But I'll remember the way we were,
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave,
Baby, you will never be lost on me.

Verse 2:
This is a goddamn shame,
I never wanted to break it,
Leave us tainted,
Know I should walk away,
But I just can't replace us,
Or even erase us,

 Song title is   The Man by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Now, I don't wanna hate you,
Just wish you'd never gone for the man,
And waited two weeks, at least,
Before you'd let him take you,
I stayed true, kind of knew,
You liked the dude from private school,
He's waiting for the time to move,
I knew he had his eyes on you,
He's not the right guy for you,
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth,
No, I would never lie to you,
But it was never fine to lose you,
And what a way to find out,
It never came from my mouth,
You never changed your mind,
But you were just afraid to mind out,
But **** it,
I won't be changing the subject, I love it,
I'll make your little secret public,
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons,
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me,
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep,
Fact is you're mad at me,
Because I backtrack so casually,
You're practically my family,
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be,
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live,
But would it kill to give it one more shot?,
I think not,

Verse 2:
Recently, I'll tend to zone out,
Up in my headphones to Holocene,
You promised your body but I'm away so much,
I stay more celibate than in a monastery,
I'm not cut out for life on the road,
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much,
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me,
I guess I'm not the man that you need,
Ever since you went to uni',
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack,
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad,
But when I broke the industry,
That's when I broke your heart,
I was supposed to chart and celebrate,
But good things are over fast,
I know it's hard to deal with and see this,
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features,
Then I turn the music off,
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus,
I never really want to believe this,
Got advice from my dad and he,
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need,
I guess I'm unaware of it,
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with,
Chorus:
I don't love you, baby,
I don't need you, baby,
I don't want you, no,
Anymore,
I don't love you, baby,
I don't need you, baby,
I don't wanna love you, no,
Anymore.

Verse 3:
And since you left, I've given up my days off,
It's what I need to stay strong,
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7,
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook,
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could,
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist,
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid,
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink,
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral and it's,
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill,
And I'll be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill,
Go down in history as just a wasted talent,
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ****?,
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me,
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be,
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this,
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****,
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty,
But I had to get this off my chest,
Chorus:
I don't love you, baby,
I don't need you, baby,
I don't want you, no,
Anymore,
I don't love you, baby,
I don't need you, baby,

 Song title is   Drunk by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all,
Love will scar your makeup lipsticks to me,
So now, I'll maybe lean back there,
I'm sat here, wishin' I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.

Pre-Chorus:
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold, I'll be freezin',
Can't rely on my heart to beat it,
'Cause you take part of it every evenin',
Take words out of my mouth just from breathin',
Replace with phrases like, When you leavin' me?,
Should I? Should I?.

Chorus:
Maybe I'll get drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
To feel a little love,
You might also likeVerse 2:
I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I got no plans for the weekend,
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?,
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to,
There may be other people like us,
We'll see the flicker of the clipper when they light up,
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before,
You don't hold me anymore.

Pre-Chorus:
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name,
I know I can't heal things with a handshake,
You know I can't change, as I began saying,
You cut me wide open like a landscape,
Open bottles of beer but never champagne,
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make,
Should I? Should I?.

Chorus:
Maybe I'll get drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
To feel a little love,
Bridge:
All by myself,
I'm here again,
All by myself,
You know I'll never change,
All by myself,
All by myself.

Chorus:
I'm just drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,

 Song title is   One Life by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives,
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine,
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life,
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?,
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two,
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you,
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do,
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth.

Pre-Chorus:
Why am I feelin' so nervous when,
Things are goin' so perfect? And,
But I know that it's worth it to,
Spend forever with you.

Chorus:
And so I count to three and get on one knee,
And I ask you,
Darlin', honestly,
I've waited all this time just to make it right,
So I'll ask you (Tonight),
Will you marry me? Just say yes,
One word, one love, one life.

Verse 2:
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair,
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware,
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes,
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives,
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red,
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed,
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth,
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you,

 Song title is   Runaway by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I've known it for a long time,
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine,
Disappearing all night,
I don't wanna know where he's been lying,
I know what I wanna do,
Wanna runaway, runaway with you,
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go.

Pre-Chorus:
How long you leaving?,
Well, Dad, just don't expect me back this evening,
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this,
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but.

Chorus:
I love him from my skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows,
I'll just run away and be on my own.

Verse 2:
I've never seen my dad cry,
Cold as stone in the kitchen light,
I'll tell you it's about time,
But I was raised to keep quiet,
This is what I'm gonna do,
Gonna run away, gonna make that move,
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go,

Bridge:
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back,
As I packed my clothes up,
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack,
Intends to show love,
I don’t wanna live this way,
Gonna take my things and go,
If things change in a matter of days,
I could be persuaded to hold on,
Mama was the same,
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that,
I don't wanna run away,
And one of these days, I might just show that,
Put my home in a suitcase,
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that,
Things change, but for now, I'll leave town,
With a backpack on my shoulder,
Chorus:
I love him from my skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows,
I'll just run away and be on my own,
 

 Song title is   The Parting Glass by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Of all the money that e'er I had,
I spent it in good company,
And all the harm that e'er I've done,
Alas, it was to none but me,
And all I've done for want of wit,
To memory now, I can't recall,
So fill to me the parting glass,
Good night and joy be with you all.

Verse 2:
Of all the comrades that e'er I had,
They are sorry for my going away,
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had,
They would wish me one more day to stay,
But since it falls unto my lot,
That I should rise and you should not,
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call,
Good night and joy be with you all.

Verse 3:
A man may drink and not be drunk,
A man may fight and not be slain,
A man may court a pretty girl,
And, perhaps, be welcomed back again,
But since it has so ought to be,
By a time to rise and a time to fall,
Come fill to me the parting glass,
Good night and joy be with you all,
Good night and joy be with you allYou might also lik,
 

 Song title is   2step by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace,
Stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break,
Something's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,
And all we need is us to go all,

Verse 2:
What do you reckon, is it just me?,
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep,
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart,
If you don't see it, you should trust me,
I feel like I got nothin' left right now,
Except this beauty in her dress right now,
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs,
So we press play and step to the beat.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace,
Stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break,

I feel it, can you feel it tonight?,
I feel the fire between you and I,
I mean it, don't you turn off the light,
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no,
She was like Damn¨,
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand,
So don't make plans,
For nothing but me and a lil' romance, hey,
You and I, whiskey on ice,
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights,
So keep 'em on with nothing on,
Ooh-my-my-my.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra:
I was rolling up something with you,
Kickin' back in a way that we do,
I got everything I need in this room,
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume,
And all my friends are in the club,
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr),
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah),
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow).

Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah,
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah,

Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación,
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar,
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción,
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; ¡wuf!),
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (Ey; wuh),
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa,
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar,

Eighty thousand singin' with me,

Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you,

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?,
Little moments that pass us by,
Oh, but I remember.

And I can't wait to make a million more first times,

 Song title is   Little Lady by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Mikill Pane:
Listen, little lady,
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday,
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes,
Lady, the word rape sums up events that take place every night,
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try,
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night,
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry,
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for,
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw,
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure,
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door,
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker,
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't,
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him,
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
She's just under the upper hand,
And goes mad for a couple grams,
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight,
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland,
And sell love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
For angels to fly,

Little lady, your mind, you've made up,
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up,
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just,
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb,
With any luck, you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip,
Last year when your pimp just lost it,
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway,
'Cause all the heroin is makin' you age,
But you're a heroine for takin' the strain of bein' a prostitute and punching bag,
The funds you have left go where you're from usin' MoneyGram,
Mother had to get you out of the motherland to study,
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand,
Little does she know you're never comin' back,
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan,
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer,
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
She's just under the upper hand,
And goes mad for a couple grams,
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight,
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland,
And sell love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
Bridge: Ed Sheeran:
Now an angel will die, covered in white,
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life,
This time now, we'll fade out tonight,
Straight down the line.

Little lady, you're tremblin' with fear,
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer,
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear,
The meddlin' nurse couldn't just leave it,
She's only gone and made it much worse callin' police in,
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused,
You're causing scandal goin' mad in the ward now,
The cop is tryin' to calm you, tellin' you he won't let no one to harm you,
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, Who you working for?,
He's talkin' to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore,
You're havin' a conversation you could be murdered for,
You're learnin' more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court,
He's kickin' knowledge you ain't ever heard before,
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard,
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card,
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid,
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own,
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe,
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home,
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat,
And then a voice says, Where you been, bitch? I wanna know,
No prizes for guessin' who it is, resistance would be foolishness,
You open the front door, he boots you in,
There's somethin' new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror,
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error,
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight,
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes,
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor,
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye,
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece,
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street,
Little lady left this earth in the worst way,
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday,
Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
And we're all under the upper hand,
And goin' mad for a couple grams,
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight,
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland,
And sell love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
For angels to fly,
And fly, fly,
For angels to fly,
To fly, to fly,
And angels to di,

Chicken, chicken wings,
They're my favourite things and I love to sing,

He made a song about chicken from Nando's,
And are you gonna bang yo?,
Yes please I want some chicken right now,
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes,
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken,
With the fucking breasts and the wings,

 Song title is   Autumn Leaves by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Another day, another life,
Passes by just like mine,
It's not complicated,
Another mind, another soul,
Another body to grow old,
It's not complicated.

Hook 1:
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?,
Float down, like autumn leaves,
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep,
And you're miles away,
And yesterday you were here with me.

Verse 2:
Another tear, another cry,
Another place for us to die,
It's not complicated,
Another life that's gone to waste,
Another light lost from your face,
It's complicated.

Hook 2:

Float down, like autumn leaves,
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep,

 Song title is   Eraser (Extended F64 Version) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind,
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine,
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride,
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind,
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life,
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride,
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive,
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride,
You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs,
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun,
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up,
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become,
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me,
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree,
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry,
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key,
And you'll see.

Chorus 1:
I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me,
But with that said give me one more, higher,
Another one to take the sting away,
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
Eraser,
Verse 2:
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs,
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong,
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell,
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well,
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps,
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun,
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run,
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become,
Our conversations with my father on the A14,
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams,
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me,
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans,
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou,
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud,
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed,
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now,
Somehow.

Chorus 2:
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me,
But with that said give me one more, higher,
Another one to take the sting away,
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
Eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
Eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror,
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner,
The industry told me to look like them,
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner,
I wish that she could have been my first time,
And I wish that I'd never took that first line,
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed,
But forgive me if it doesn't,
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin,
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't,
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin',
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and,
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen,
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party,
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?,
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it,
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget,
But while we're on the subject,
I wish my private life would have never gone public,
But that's the sacrifice that we make,
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away.

Chorus 3:
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here,
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear,
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care,
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish,
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here,
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear,
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care,
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish,
Verse 4:
I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy,
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy,
I found myself late night wishin' on a star,
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh,
And I wish I'd never run through,
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to,
I wish I was the role model you looked up to,
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, Fuck you,
I wish I was home more,
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour,
And I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more,
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for,
And I wish he never got cancer,
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?,
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause,
Every day this cocaine gets the best of us,
Usin' my balance on razor blades,
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait.

Chorus 3:
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here,
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear,
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care,
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish,

Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care,
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish.

Verse 5:
I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat,
Mum sayin', Don't smoke, no, I don't listen, I got,
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast,
People that I don't know share the same vision,
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine,
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign,
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme,
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine,
Shit quick before I hit it again,
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men,
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen,
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again,
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick,
My daddy told me, Work hard and you can never be shit,
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad,
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had,
One wish,
 

 Song title is   Hands of Gold (Game of Thrones) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse:
He rode through the streets of the city,
Down from his hill on high,
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble,
He rode to a woman's sigh,
For she was his secret treasure,
She was his shame and his bliss,
And a chain and a keep are nothing,
Compared to a woman's kiss.

Refrain:
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are ...You might also lik,

Verse 1:
I have grown up, I am a father now,
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow,
You know I've never been afraid of death,
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet,
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down,
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out,
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth,
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it.

Pre-Chorus:
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes,
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again,
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days,
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе.

Chorus:
Time stops to still,
When you are in my arms, it always will,
And lifе, life is changin' tides.

Verse 2:
I lost the confidence in who I was,
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up,
I have the same dream every night,
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes,
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down,
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out,
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace,
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way,

I can feel the paradise before my world implodes,
And tonight had something wonderful,
(Grr, mm-mm, yeah).

Verse 2: Tion Wayne & Ed Sheeran:
Feds havin' nightmares when I got my ice,
Gyal up on my left side, gyal up on my right (Mm-mm),
Six figure transfer when I cop my ride (Baow, baow, baow),
That's why the opps them just wanna take my life,
Before the music, had to put a shift in (Damn),
Made Lambo money from a Citröen (Boom),
I was tapped then, rolling with my kitchen,
That's why they want me just lock up in thе system,
Bad habits in my life, in my veins (In my vеins),
Bad habits in the nine with a babe (Boom),
Bad habits, can't end up with a case,
Man, them bad vibes just haffi go away,
'Cause I was broke, getting Ps weren't easy (Easy),
I'm with Sheeran now, it's cheeky (Mad),
Feds can't believe I'm on TV,
They're havin' flashbacks of CCTV,
Tough luck (Ooh), he got brucked up (Ooh),
In my drop-top (Ooh), getting top-top (Boom),
And my young buck, if he catch an opp-opp,
No Double-E ting, bidda-bop-bop (Boom),
But fuck what you're tellin' 'em (Buh), I'm from Edmonton (Buh),
Bad vibes everyting ****,

I don't wanna go on a mad one,
Them say somethin' I can't come back from,
Frontways, sideways, cowgirl, backshots,
Mr. Miyagi, wax off, wax on,
I don't even smoke, she want a backstrap one,
Messed up with my good girl and a sad one,
Now I'm in a hotel room with a bad one,
Strapped up, I don't wanna give mum a grandson,
These ladies moving crazy, uh,
Wanna have babies by me,
Lately I've been keepin' my head down,
Ain't been wildin', takin' time out,
Cards laid out, got nothin' to hide 'bout,
Ayy, maybe I slipped up once on a night out,
If she find out 'bout that, she wild out,
The sex feel better when you make up,
After you break up, all body language,
Don't wanna say much,
We could go back to the AP and lay up,
Or fuck in the back of the Bentley Bentayga,
Come home late, she wake, she stayin' up,
Body intact, no personal trainer,
Breakfast in bed, don't cook me no bacon,
I just want head when I wake up,
Chorus: Tion Wayne & Central Cee:
I got gyal up in Chelsea, you know,
But why everyone there when you blow?,
The feds tryna get help with the roads,
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know,

But everyone disappears when you're broke,
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care,
I'm putting my career on hold.

Verse 4: Tion Wayne & Central Cee:
Bad night if we back out the pumpy (Grr),
Bad sight when me keep up the fuckery (Baow),
If I bang him in the face, can't stop me (Mm-mm),
Bad time, but today I'm lucky,
Yo, in the rave with the gauge (Baow),
Bad habits, can't end up in a cage (Boom),
Bang at anyone, straight in the face (Baow, baow, mm-mm),
She left me on read back then when I had no bread,
Like shorty didn't trust the process,
Free all the guys locked down four walls,
When I think 'bout that, I get claustrophobic,
Pure cocaine, no bakin' soda,
Lot of ammonia, I don't condone it,
But you gotta do what you gotta do,
When you're stuck in the hood just hopin',
I-I-I was lickin' 'em, stickin' them, left as an artist,
Dylan just fill up and empty the cartridge,
Do it like Sheringham, shoot up the rahted,
Think I won't pull up and bark it (Baow, baow),
When I fly out the M-way, I feel nostalgic,
Yay come white like yam, it ain't pounded,
Looking for cribs, just fully detached,
I came from council housin',
Not in a talk-the-talk, I really walk the walk,
Man, this a masterclass, man you can ask the charts,
Richard Mille on, you don't know the pass, the password,
When it's really on, Wizzy gotta clart it off,
No fears 'cah I'm good on the roads where I'm from,
You can ask, I'm calm as long as my darg is,
Always aim at the target market,
Look at the profit margin,
Chorus: Tion Wayne & Central Cee:
I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know,
But why everyone there when you blow?,
The feds tryna get help with the roads,

I need to tell you you're beautiful,
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize,
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin',
Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin',
If I stopped and took a look around,
It's in front of my eyes, eyes.

Pre-Chorus:
Baby, let's slow down time,
Maybe just press rewind,
Darlin', that dress reminds,
Me of the first time.

Chorus:
And I wanna love tonight,
One on one by the candlelight,
Over and over, we spend our lives,
Livin' fast forward but not tonight,
Love in slow motion.

Verse 2:
It's been a while since it was you and me,
Too many friends, too many evening drinks,
Yeah, we commit to so many things,
But not to ourselves, and I apologize,
Sometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin',
And I brush it off because there's always somethin',
But I need to change my perspective,
And prioritise-ise,

Can be restored with your lips,
It only takes one kiss.

Over and over, we spend our lives,
Livin' fast forward but not tonight,
Love in slow motion,

Another night, another club,
Another room, another one,

And every time I get close, I run wild and explode,
I don't know why, you're not enough.

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy,
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine,
When you're eighteen but when you're older,
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes,
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long,
But you never know though,
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely,
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart,

 Song title is   Stop The Rain by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Another human cloud to bring you down,
When you blew the last away,
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown,
But for me, they look the same,
Well, sometimes, it can get all too much for me,
And that's why the photograph gets burned,
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy.

Pre-Chorus:
Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry,
Tomorrow is another day.

Chorus:
You cannot stop the rain, no way,
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again,
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play,
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame,
But that's just the way I feel.

Post-Chorus:
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Verse 2:
Another I, Me, Mine to blur the lines,
Between love and then heartbreak,

Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy,

Can be so much more than a wake-up call,

Between you and I,
There's one thing I can't change.

 Song title is   The City by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
This city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it's late,
Sirens bleed through my windowsill,
I can't close my eyes,
Don't control what I'm into,
And this tower is alive,
The lights that blind keep me awake,
Hood up and lace untied,
Sleep fills my mind,
Can't control what I'm into.

Pre-Chorus:
London calls me a stranger, a traveller,
This is now my home, my home (Woo!).

Chorus:
I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two.

Verse 2:
The pavement is my friend,
It will take me where I need to go,
I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I'm used to,
And the shop across the road,
Fills my needs and gives me company when I need it,
Voices speak through my walls,
I don't think I'm gonna make it,
Past tomorrow,

With the sound of the city life echoed in my head,
Do I need this to keep me alive?,
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along,

London calls me a stranger,
This is not my home, home.

Chorus:
I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here sitting in the backseat,

I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam),
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram,
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef,
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek,
I bought an AP to help me time keep,
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak,
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy),
Leave you wet like you scuba dived,
We were younger then and now we're unified,
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone.

Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy:
It's that time,
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime,
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing,
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes,
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy,
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint,
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub,
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I,
But that's my fault (Oh),
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh),
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh),
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah),
He said, Teddy, never get off your high horse,
And never let 'em take your crown,
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles,
But I'm heading back to London town right now,

Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie',

Made a change to get paid,

Jaykae, make a lot of P (Uh),
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be,
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G,

Aim this one at your head,
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead,

 Song title is   No Name (The Bastard Executioner Theme Song) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Born with a heart,
That could ache more than beat,
The mind of the killer,
The soul of the meek,
Born aimless and angry,
Ran hard from the day,
Left love at the crossroad,
Into a man that I hate.

Pre-Chorus:
Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?,
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?,
Should I drop to my knees?,
Scream your name out in vain?,
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?.

Chorus:
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?.

Verse 2:
I fight for the hope,
That blood has a face,
To give me a kiss,
For the faith that I wait,
Flock with no shepherd,
Is a vulnerable game,
I can live without heart, without love,
But I do need a name,

 Song title is   You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows,
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know,
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant,
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate,
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin,
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in,
I do it for the hell of it,
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit,
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image,
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick,
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses,
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this,
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative,
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is,
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is,
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing,
I'm back to sing this.

Hook: Ed Sheeran:

Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up,
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch,
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching,
Now I've found out being odd ain't even,
I qualified for everything, long straight season,
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening,
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in,
MC with the mic is MC dinner time,
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light,
I didn't even have to do a disco rap,
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque,
This is what happens when your gift is talent,
And all you imagined exists, imagine,
I never drop shit and I came from the back end,
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it.

Hook:.

Verse 3: Devlin:
You need me, but I dont need you,
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32,
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all,
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall,
Like autumn, check my post mortem,
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune,
I don't mean money, I mean luck,
But now the clock's aviated,
Everybody's time's up,
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave,
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place,
Keep your diamonds and your chains,
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe,
Cause I get respected,
While they get detested,
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did,
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9,
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line,

 Song title is   You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live Ustream Version) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd,
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud,
I can’t, no, I won’t hush,
I’ll say the words that make you blush,
I’m gonna sing this now,
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue I stick to other artists,
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures,
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me,
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy,
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me.

Chorus 1:
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell,
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell,
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing,
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing,
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School,
I came fast with the way I act, right,
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe,
And I won’t be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia,
And musically I’m demonstrating,
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating,
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me,
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi.

Chorus 1:
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you,
You need me, man, I don’t need you,

Verse 3:
And all I want in this cold world is to make music and use it,
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music,
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?,
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me,
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely,
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?,
Hey, so I keep singing that,
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters,
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar,
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark,
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody,
Hennessey shots and... all these fools on the block,
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise the top?,
Just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy,
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die,
So see the signs, stand to the side,
Open your eyes and take a look and realise,
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears,
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, A lone star,
Urban Angel rising from the ashes, surprising all haters,
Guiding, now moving steady when we say.

Pre-Chorus:
Ayy, ayy, we bring the stars out,
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out,
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out,
And we can do this until we pass out, pass out,
Yeah, we bring the stars out,
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out,
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out,
And we can do this until we pass out,

My eyes are red I've been burning,
I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade,
My eyes are red I've been burning,
I've been burning, burning, burning.

Verse 4:
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit,
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it,
'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic,
'Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit,
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood,
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should,
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good,
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel,
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug,
And if I start to smoke it I'ma-nna turn into a thug,
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged,
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above,
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub,
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love,
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine,
I blaze high grade weed all the time.

Chorus 2:
Now my eyes are red,
'Cause you need me, I don't need you,
You need me man, my eyes are red,
You need me man, I don't need you,

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right,
I won't stop until my name's in lights,
At stadium heights, with Damian Rice,
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights,
Because I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice,
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper,
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah,
The game's over but now I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal,
People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows but,
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch,
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out,
Wow, from day one I've been prepared,
With V05 wax for my ginger hair,
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of,
What the future holds cause it's another day,
Plus,
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic,
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it,
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces,
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers,
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors,
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache,
I hit back, when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though,
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos,
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio,
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio,
Melody music maker, reading all the papers,
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator,
 

 Song title is   Penguins by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle,
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful,
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care,
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere.

Pre-Chorus:
Well, darlin', here we go again,
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes,
Don't  you know we're only human?, is what I heard you say,
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain,
'Cause  I have felt the same, no.

Chorus:
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice,
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try,
And I see a hope that's in her eyes,
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?.

Verse 2:
She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine,
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined,
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go,
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls.

Pre-Chorus:
Well, darlin', here we go again,
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts,
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are,
And I could put you back together when you come apart,
And we should make a start now, oh,

Oh, can you see the love in mine?,
Oh, can you see the love in mine?,
 

 Song title is   Sandman by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
You were loved before you had arrived,
And every day that love just multiplies,
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby,
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky,
And lovin' you is easy,
But life will not always be,
Fall into the world of your song,
Whatever you feel could never be wrong.

So go to sleep, my lovе,
Hangin' out with the Sandman.

Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars,
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon,
Marshmallow books and strawberries,
Snowmen made of ice cream,

Honeybees and birds sing your song,
Whatever you feel can never be wrong,

 Song title is   Salt Water by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
There's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes,
When the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole,
Yeah, the blades are two feet tall,
I wade in green, I'm movin' forward, to where? God only knows,
Feel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face,
Saying, It's alright to run from all this pain,
Oh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs,
I'll scream, It's all for love, I'll scream, It's all for love.

Chorus:
Come and kiss me, salt water,
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees,
I'm free in salt water,
Embrace the deep and leave everything,
It was just a dream.

I can see it up ahead where the sky meets the ground,
And after that, there's only moving grey,
I am filled up with regret,
With things I did or never said, just leave that well alone.

 Song title is   Be Right Now by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
A lifetime is startin' to feel like,
It's fallin' short of the mark,
But it's all that we got,
Every teardrop, every wrong turn,
Made the moment we found,
And it's comin' around, around, around, around, around.

Chorus:
I don't wanna miss one thing,

Just stay here and be right now.

 Song title is   2step (Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace,
Stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break,
Something's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,

Everything that I'd been dealin' with ain't even crossed my mind,
I don't see nobody in here but us, for real, for you I'm blind,
We go anywhere, don't take much for us to catch a vibe,
Come here, I need to tell you somethin', let me whisper in your ear,
Do whatever to get you there, I'll put you on a Lear, yeah,
Private island for a month straight, they'll think you disappeared,
Lamb truck'll look good on you, I'm coppin' you that Urus,
I think I'm 'bout ready to make love in this club,
Only thing I need is my drink and my drugs,
I done got on ten and forgot where I was,
Some parts I don't like, but this part I love,
Only me and my guys,
I been havin' me a good time, you can see it all in my eyes,
Two-steppin' with shawty, got her rockin' side to side,

 Song title is   End Of Youth by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine,
Stopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight,
If you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man,
You can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land,
Tried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size,
Tell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice,
Half remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear,
Can't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears.

Pre-Chorus:
It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there.

Chorus:
Is this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?,
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go,
Everything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure,
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low.

Post-Chorus:
We spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open,
And then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth.

Verse 2:
I've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright,
All my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life,
Just a boy at the start, they lent on like a man,
You were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can,
Disengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel,
No one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel,
If I slip and get high, I know the low is always near,
When I'm down, I never see you, when I'm up, you all appear,

 Song title is   Spark by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
We've been lost for a long time,
In a rut, no escape signs,
And, for love, we were so blind,
Oh, I hate to see you cry,
There've been times where the truth lied,
Now, it's clear as a blue sky.

Pre-Chorus:
Like a Band-Aid over deeper cuts, we tried,
We couldn't stop the fate descending on the night.

Chorus:
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives,
And hope the spark survives,
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky,
Let the memories take flight,
And hope the spark survives.

Post-Chorus:
Yeah, we hope the spark survives.

Verse 2:
Oh, I wonder, will we pull through?,
All we ever do is argue,
With not a lot, but we make do,
How I wish you wouldn't say that,
There are things you can't take back,
When you leave, I always face facts,

Five drinks in on Friday night,
We only came to dry your eyes,
And get you out of your room,

In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn,
Oh no no, the sun could rise,
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM,
So DJ, play it again.

By yourself,
And every day,

Sunlight is framin' our every moment,
What a way to start off the day with you.

Flick a finger,
Start a discussion to pick a singer,
This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her,
Just let the speakers take you away.

Chorus:

Frost on the leaves like a lake,
The moment came out of nothin',
A beautiful smile on your face,

But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry,
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty.

 Song title is   Don’t (Rick Ross Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Rick Ross:
Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver,
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver,
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check,
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet,
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys,
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin',
On a back block you may catch the boss,
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off,
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey,
No prom date, women they would love to hate me,
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch,
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this,
See it my way or see me at the top,
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock,
Microphone check, microphone check,
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left.

Verse 2: Ed Sheeran:
I met this girl late last year,
She said don't you worry if I disappear,
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake,
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait,
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned,
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn,
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right,
I went away for months until our paths crossed again,
She told me I was never looking for a friend,
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin,
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM,
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing,
Hook: Ed Sheeran:
Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my arm,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe.

Verse 3: Ed Sheeran:
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her,
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza,
Before a text message was the only way to reach her,
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her,
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature,
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either,
But me and her, we make money the same way,
Four cities, two planes, the same day,
And those shows have never been what it's about,
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out,
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch,
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now,
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out,
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about,
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing,
Hook: Ed Sheeran:
Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my arm,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe.

Verse 4: Ed Sheeran:
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door,
I don't even know if she knows what for,
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya,
Trust and respect is what we do this for,
I never intended to be next,
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all,
And I never saw him as a threat,
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course,
It's not like we were both on tour,
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor,
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different,
This is not the way you realised what you wanted,
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest,
And all this time, God knows I'm singing,
Hook: Ed Sheeran:
Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my arm,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't fuck with my love,

Ed Sheeran and Kranium,
You know your body look good,

Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
The club isn't the best place to find a lover,
So the bar is where I go,
Me and my friends at the table doing shots,
Drinking fast and then we talk slow,
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me,
And trust me I'll give it a chance now,
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox,
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like.

Girl, you know I want your love,
Your love was handmade for somebody like me,

 Song title is   She by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I paid all my dues,
And she wanted to know,
That I’d never leave her,
But now I’m ready to go,
And strange as it seems,
She’s endless to me,
She’s just like paperwork,
But harder to read.

Chorus:
Patience's my enemy,
And loving’s my friend,
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve,
Than to stay and just pretend,
Oh, she knows me so well,
Oh, she knows me like I know myself.

Verse 2:
I made all my plans,
And as she has made hers,
She kept me in mind,
But I wasn’t sure,
I searched every room,
For a way to escape,
But every time I tried to leave,
She keeps holding on to me for dear life,
And blocking my way,

 Song title is   Curtains by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine,
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway,
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright,
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day.

Verse 1:
Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away,
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game,
I can't be seen and you won't find me today,
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay.

Pre-Chorus:
Are you alright? Maybe don't ask,
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that,
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back,
And I always wear long sleeves,
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?,
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last,
And if I could, I would try to take it all back,
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me.

Chorus:
Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine,
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway,
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright,
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day,

Verse 2:
Hide and seek, count to ten and close your eyes,
Try to breathe, see a message and don't reply,
Nice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye,
Life can be so beautiful if you try.

Pre-Chorus:
Are you okay? Yeah, I guess so,
But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole,
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know,
That the mountain feels so steep,
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load,
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul,
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold,
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me.

Chorus:
Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine,
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway,
It's been forever but I'm feelin' alright,
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day,

 Song title is   2step (Ukrainian Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we’re here right now.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin’ life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's got to change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin’ with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin’ when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We’ll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved,
And all we need is us to go all,

Night, night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
Night, yeah,

Verse 2: Антитіла:
Сирени обірвали наш сон, у дві валізи все минуле,
Далі go go, ти за кермо, у невідоме,
І всі нерви в кулак, і не рви мене так,
Я залишаюся вдихати дим,
Останні запахи Dior із ним,
Я пам'ятаю, ти хотіла в Рим,
Все йде до того, що спочатку на Крим, ми свій двіж замутим,
Ніхто не вийде із води сухим,
Нас застав напряжний ранок як серіал-драма,
Місяцями герої ми тут і ми тут шоураннери,
Горить сюжет, скільки ще ракет,
Мила, обіцяю, коли все мине,
Я танцюватиму з тобою so slow,
І цілуватиму тебе де любов-ов-ов,
Знов і знов, чекай мене, коли все це мине,
Я впаду з тобою в цей flow,
Зацілую туди, де любов-ов-ов,
Знов і знов, чекай мене, коли все це мине,
Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
Night, night,
Two-steppin’ with the woman I love,
Night, yeah,
All we need is us to go all night,
Night, night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
Night, yeah,
All we need is us to go all night,
 

 Song title is   Vega by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass,
But, God, I love the sound of heaven,
Sat cross-legged on the carpet,
Listenin' to vinyl, trying to ignore the weather.

Pre-Chorus:
This week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight,
What can you do, but pray?,
And count your blessings, it wasn't any other way,
Don't leave it up to fate.

Chorus:
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part,
Light up the night, we were made to be stars,
But it burns like hell to be Vega.

Verse 2:
Clouds keep forming over this house,
Blocking out the sun, I'm trying to keep it all together,
One door closes then one opens, gotta keep the focus,
If we believe, then she'll get better.

Pre-Chorus:
The days are long, but they pass within an instant, babe,
It is the strangest thing,
I'll count my blessings the day I see you smile again,
This war, we've got to win,

Keep it inside, don't let no one see your heart,
No one can judge, we're the same in the dark,
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part,
Light up the night, we were made to be stars,
But it burns like hell to be Vega.

Bridge:
Same problems, different options,
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this,
Need rest-bite, bleed time dry,
She'll be fine, she'll be fine,
Same problems, different options,
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this,
Need rest-bite, bleed time dry,
She'll be fine, she'll be fine.

Outro:
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, worrying to death,
But I guess this is human nature,
We are made to shine like stars, but,
That don't mean it don't burn like hell to be Vega,
 

 Song title is   Colourblind by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Kaleidoscope love, yeah, that is you and me,
Forever changing, we make life interesting,
Some days, we're red and some days, we both think green,
But I like the nights when we leave the canvas free.

Pre-Chorus:
Grab a brush and see where the feelin' may lead,
Nothin' is out of our reach,
Our words are mixing the pigment we need,
Can we get started?.

Chorus:
I keep fallin' deeper in dark blue,
Brighter than white, rainbows exploding,
But I can't see nothin' еxcept you and your eyes,
Maybе we'll just paint the night colourblind.

Verse 2:
In every spectrum, we find the millionth piece,
Connect the dots and everything in between,
Mmm, dull in the moment, you'll turn it golden leaf,
You take the dark away and that's no easy feat.

Pre-Chorus:
Pick an orange, watch the shade change in the heat,
From yellow, purple and green,
Your words are mixin' each pigment we need,
Can we get started?,

 Song title is   Homeless by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?,
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors,
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur,
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt,
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides,
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time,
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey.

Pre-Chorus:
I haven't slept for the past week,
Two hours ain't enough for me,
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am,
I haven't changed since our last meet,
I'm still getting all my meals for free,
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again.

Chorus:
It's not a homeless life for me,
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be,
And it's not a homeless life for me,

 Song title is   F64 by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Yo, Jam, this is a letter to you,
It's been a while, but it's been hard for me to get in the booth,
And since we last spoke, I've become a father of two,
Tryna live life with a smile, but that's been harder to do,
'Cause all I wanna do is talk about you,
But these tears won't let me talk about you,
We should've known that we'd be lost without you,
Therapy sessions, diggin' deep in depression,
I got a life full of blessings, but this just breaks my fuckin' heart,
At your birthday, couldn't even crack a smile,
I just cried and left the party, Neesh, I'll see you in while,
Headed to the mural, got some jerk wings and plantain,
'Cause that is the way that me and you would celebrate it,
I never knew you touched the stuff, 'cause you'd always bad me up,
If you saw me more than drunk, you always hated what it does,
Before Lyra, I just stopped, I haven't even wanted one,
I can't get over this, it's fucked, man, I wished I'd known,
And yo, we cried for nine nights in your family home,
Laid you to rest in the ground but without a stone,
You know it hits me most at moments now when I'm alone,
Every morning, I remember that you're really gone.

Chorus:
'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother,
You know for life, got your sis and mother,
And day and night, it still hits that you're gone,
And right now I'm spillin' tears in my cup,
You left the world 'fore you met Jupiter,
Wish you'd have known you would be godfather,
You would've loved lovin' my little girls,
If not for them, I'd be done with the world,

Was there two hours after you passed,
Speedin' east to west, silent in the back of the car,
Was at your mum's, there all week, tryna make sense but I can't,
And although it's been a year, still feel the pain in my heart,
'Cause you were there from the start,
The day we met, yeah, I moved in and we were never apart,
People assumed that we were lovers, but we're brothers in arms,
Symbiotic bond of love and gave each other a chance, my god, ah,
Fuck sake,
Lately I've been cryin' so much, my lungs ache,
Teardrops all over my shirt like blood stains,
And I know to heal a heart, it must break,
But I'm done prayin', they,
Gave me a shovel at your burial,
And watchin' you get lowered is somethin' I can't forget at all,
And people find and stop me in the street and say it's terrible,
But they don't know you like I knew you and they never will,
No one saw the nights turn into day when we were battle rappin',
No one saw the belly laugh, and every train to somewhere random,
No one saw the holidays, and then our first experience clubbin',
No one knew the things you did for me and never asked for nothin',
No one read the conversations of the moves that we were plannin',
No one knew about the way you felt the scene, left you abandoned,
No one knew about your fears 'cause you would hide 'em with a smile,
No one knew when people took an inch, you would give 'em a mile,
'Cause that was always Jamal, SB to the crowd,
They used to shout your net worth, but they don't mention it now,
They hear about your good deeds and infectious smile,
A golden heart that's still remembered is worth more than a crown,
I promised sixty-four bars and now I keep it to Tanisha,
Mummy, Isaac, the gang, but I just wish that you'd seen it,
I can't accept that you're gone, or the grief that I'm feeling,
I prayed to God for answers, but He still won't give me a reason,
I think about you every day, nothing will take this pain away,
I'll keep your legacy amazin', mate,
The conversations at your grave's the only way to be close,
I know you'll greet me with a smile on the day that I go,
Chorus:
'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother,
And for life, got your sis and mother,
You know I cry 'cause I miss my brother,
My brother was SBTV,
 

 Song title is   The Hills of Aberfeldy by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Oh, the leaves are covered in snow,
And the water's frozen,
Oh, I long for you to be the one that I'm holdin',
And warm me down to my bones,
As you lay beside me, hold me close,
Oh, the leaves are starting to fall,
And the sun grows cold,
And my heart might break from the weight of it all,
For all that I know,
You could be holding somebody else as close.

Chorus:
And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to,
Yet I know that I have never told you,
Darling, we could fall in lovе 'neath the hills of Aberfеldy.

Oh, the ground is slowly melting,
And the sun beats strong,
And I feel like my feet may have wandered too long,
And I will remain here alone,
'Cause I fear that you may have found someone.

And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to,

And all the clubs you get in using my name,
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake,
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't.

 Song title is   One Night by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson,
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance,
Hey, did I mention, as she makes an entrance,
Said I had a tendency to finish off her sentence?,
Oh, well, she's a local girl,
No make-up 'cause she knows me well,
Hair tied up in elastic band,
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man,
Is it fast food? I'll regret it after,
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her,
So she buys me chips and cheese,
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need,
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley,
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi,
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat,
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly,
She knows me well,
Bit of a catch to have a local girl,
Hair tied up in elastic band,
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man.

Pre-Chorus:
I don't wanna go alone,
I don't wanna go alone,
No, I don't wanna go alone,

And we've got that love in us, so if the drink kill us,
We're gonna dance all night 'til the floor feel us,
If we talk outside, so you hate wasps, too?,
I don't really dance, so I'll just watch you,
Are you taking me back tonight?,
Tell me if that’s alright, I don't wanna be here,
I'm not the sofa type,
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don't mind sharing,
She said, I wanna take off what you're wearing.

Pre-Chorus:

Sadness always finds an in,
Sneaks its way past, infecting everything,
And every chapter has an end,
But this is one momentous sequel, don't you think?.

Pre-Chorus:
And the blackbirds, they fly,
Like a frown on the skyline.

Chorus:

Which way will I?.

Guess I should take this on the chin,
But I don't even know how all of this began,
And we are made to mould and bend,
How can I wish for nothing when it's still a sin?.

Engulfed in darkness, shielded from my eyes,

This is the last song I'm writin' 'bout you,

Every moment when you took my joy away,

 Song title is   I Will Remember You by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I will remember you,
In the way you'd want me to,
But it's hard to come to terms right now,
Sunset looked today,
As if it knew you'd gone away,
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down.

Pre-Chorus:
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain,
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden,
And it's time for me to call your son again,
And say.

Chorus:
She was the starlight in darkness,
She was the first bloom in spring,
An angel with a smile like electric light,
All the time, hit her wings,
She was the birdsong in morning,
But now everything here has changed,
All the world's less beautiful,
Since you've been away.

Verse 2:
I will remember you,
With white wine by the barbecue,
On New York at the birthday do, downtown,
All that comes to mind,
When I think about the time,
Is a memory of laughin' out loud,
You might also likePre-Chorus:
Oh, I wish, that I could take the pain away,

My heart is racin',
And my soul is achin', lover.

Should I just throw it away?.

All my friends have settled and grown,
And then there's me, here, dancin' alone,
Fueled by heartbreak mixed with the chemicals,

Am I breathing into my detriment?,
I'll keep bleedin' and I'll be stoned.

Finns en grej med tugget.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pacе, stuck in a constant race,

We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,

Sun takes colours from the green and bleaches,
December white, a cotton dress, open lawn to make a nest,
Try to think what I love best in your features.

Chorus:
You were born to run and run till you find your fire,
I saw what you'd become, I know, I know,
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowers.

Verse 2:
Daggers wide, they cut through skin, a new addition to your grin,
To reach the end, we must begin to feel it,
Lie and trace you on the grass, hair that makеs a question mark,
You'll always be in my heart, I mеan it.

You were born to run and run till you find your fire,
I saw what you'd become, I know, I know,
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowers.

She's reinventing loving me,
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa,

On the sofa, where we lay,
I wanna stay inside all day.

And it's cold outside again,
And we're both so high.

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica,
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya,

On the sofa with you.

When the morning comes,
We're not watching Formula 1,

 Song title is   Lately by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be,
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees,
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe,
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep,
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any,
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many,
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon,
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true,
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths,
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves,
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme,
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine,
Cause real recognise real is what my father says,
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away,
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow,
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

Verse 2: Devlin:
5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire,
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require,
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead,
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?,
It's D-E-V to the Zed,
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers,
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired,
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll,
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying,
Cause I got too much to stay awake for,
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war,
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives,
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight,
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line,
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines,
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by,

The times I'm living in lately.

Verse 3: Ed Sheeran:
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth,
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out,
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those,
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy,
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be,
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in,
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with,
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in,
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows,
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone,
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro,
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow,
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework,
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older,
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie,
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die),
Verse 4: Devlin:
Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge,
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes,
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move,
We scan the situation, analyse information,
And then decide what probably is most practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets,
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true,
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em,
We got the fans all like, Oh wow it's Devs and Ed,
What less did you bloody expect from 'em?,
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment,
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock,
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake.

 Song title is   You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live at the Bedford) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show,
Every night in front of a new crowd,
That's new now, ciao, seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud,
And I can't, no, I won`t hush,
I'll say the words that make you blush,
I'm gonna sing this now,
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists,
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures,
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me,
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy,
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me.

Chorus:
Cause you need me, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell,
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell,
Call yourself a singer-writer you're just bluffing,
Your names on the credits and you didn't write nothing,
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School,
I came fast with the way I act, right,
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe,
And I won't be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia,

Verse 3:
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it,
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music,
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?,
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me,
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely,
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?,
Hey, so I keep singing that,
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters,
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar,
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark,
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody,
Hennesey shots and... all these fools on the block,
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?,
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy...,
My head in the sky... Ready to die,
Ed Sheeran, Alone Star,
Coming out here freestyling with the guitar,
Cause I've forgotten the lyrics of this bit right here,
So I freestyle off the top of the bit with the....

Interlude: In Da Club:
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub,
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex, I ain't into making love,
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly,
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex, I ain't into making love,
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,
Break:
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning,
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning,
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade,
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning.

Verse 4:
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit,
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it,
Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic,
Cos like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit,
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood,
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should,
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good,
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel,
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug,
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug,
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged,
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above,
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub,
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love,
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine,
I blaze high grade weed all the time!,
Now my eyes are red.

Chorus:
Now my eyes are red,
Cause you need me, I don't need you,
You need me man, my eyes are red,
You need me man, I don't need you,
You need me man, my eyes are red,
And you need me, I don't need you,
You need me man, my eyes are red,
You need me man, I don't need you,
You need me man, I don't need you.

Spoken:
Okay so this is the breakdown bit where we get a little bit funky. Ugh, and I forget about the whole week, you forget about the whole week, the whole weekend. Just forget about everything! 'Cause it's Sunday and we're all gonna get drunk after this and have a very, very good time and I'm not stressed anymore. We're just letting it unwind. I wanna split the room in the middle here. Who's up for that? Not, not, not literally. You don't have to literally divide. It's all good, all good. Peace and love, peace and love and harmony. What was I gonna say? This side, up there, are you with me? This side, up there, are you with me? Everyone scream as loud as you can! (screaming) Okay, so we found out that everyone's voices work. This side, I'm not gonna insult you but you are West Ham, okay? You're West Ham, yeah? You're West Ham Football Club. Get in the geezer mode, yeah? This side, you're Millwall, yeah? You two, you two hate each other. You two are gonna beat each other at whatever you do, no matter what. So if I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. If I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. Are you all up for that? Millwall, are you ready? (yeah!) West Ham, are you ready? (yeah!) Okay, West Ham, you sing this....

You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you.

Millwall, you sing this:
My eyes are red!,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, my eyes are red!,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, (my eyes are red!),
(You need me, man, I don't need you),
(You need me, man, my eyes are red!),
You need me, man, I don't need you,
Millwall are winning I think.

Verse 5:
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be,
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees,
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe,
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep,
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any,
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many,
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon,
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true,
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths,
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves,
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme,
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine,
Cause real recognise real is what my father says,
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away,
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow,
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you.

Interlude:
I got my friend, very good friend Random Impulse. He's gonna come up and he's gonna spit a few bars on the beat. Everyone give it up for Random Impulse!.

Verse 6: Random Impulse:
Yo!,
In this game, I am my own damn man, no restriction, post or boundaries,
Spouting heat, hungry and my circle always round to eat,
Crossing circles, counting thousands at a thousand feet,
Counting sheep and he's sound asleep,
Summoned from the deep, now I float, to sink my boat, you'll need a thousand fleets,
Walk on any beat and stomp it like a thousand feet,
Talk is cheap, so I could treat you to my words for free,
Now that I'm out, man, I ain't playing like I hurt my knee,
It's common courtesy, I left you for a minute,
Now I'm back and packing punches like I'm Popeye popping spinach,
Eating every course... lunch, I ain't forgotten dinners,
Play guitars as well as bars so you ain't rocking with beginners,
Sorry, time's ticking, I can't mess with up-and-comers,
National lottery business, only winners have my numbers,
Man I'm nothing like you fronters, show you how it is,
I can't really do nothing for you 'less you got something to give, Ed!.

Chorus:
Cause you need me, I don't need you,
You need me man, my eyes are red,
You need me man, I don't need you,
You need me man, my eyes are red,
And you need me, I don't need you,
You need me man, my eyes are red,
You need me man, I don't need you,
You need me.

Verse 7:
I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic,
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it,
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Into another rappers shoes using new laces,
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers,
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors,
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache,
I hit back when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago,
But more people hear me though,
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos,
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio,
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio,
Melody music maker,
Reading all the papers,
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator,
Later!,
Thank you... thank you so much! See you soon!,

My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space,
And I know I lose control of the things that I say,
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape,
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true,
My bad habits lеad to you.

Verse 1:
Now I'm in town, break it down,
Thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show every night,
In front of a new crowd,
That's you now, ciao,
Seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud,
I can't, no I won't hush,
I'll say the words that make you blush,
I'm gonna sing this now,
See, I'm true,
My songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue,
I stick to other artists,
I'm not you,
No, that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing,
And move to greener pastures,
See, I'm real, I do it all, It's all me,
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy,
I won't stay put,
Give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me,

My eyes are red, I've been burning,
I've been burning burning burning.

Verse 4:
Now, where I come burning weed it is a habit,
A big fat bag of high-grade weed you know I got to have it,
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic,
Cause like I say where I come from weed smoking is a habit,
Yeah do da burn up the place up in the hood,
One of the things that I've inherited,
Like a ghetto man you should,
One of the things is smoking weed,
Yes it makes me feel good,
But high-grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel,
Mommy, yes I'm gonna table sensimilla is a drug,
And If I start to smoke I'm gonna turn into a thug,
Where I come from all that talking,
It could only get you mugged,
Where I come from burning weed,
It is a blessing from above,
Where I come from, yes we burn it,
When we listen rob a dove,
Where I come from, yes we burn it,
After we dash to make love,
Where I come from, yes we burn it,
When the sun does shine,
I blaze high-grade weed all the time.

Chorus:

Verse 5:
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right,
I won't stop till my name's in lights,
At stadium heights, with Damien Rice,
On red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights,
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice,
Long nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper,
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter,
Yeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal,
People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows, but,
I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch,
So, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow,
From day one I've been prepared,
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair,
So now I'm back to the sofa,
Giving a dose of what the future holds-,
Cos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr,
I've still got a rucksack for the old clothes,
I rap with the cold flows,
I'm back with the most jokes,
In fact, you don't know,
On tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant,
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate,
Man, flows developing,
Skin lacks the melanin,
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in,
I do it for the hell of it,
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team,
I seem to sell a bit,
I took what held me back with the women,
And then I packaged the image,
Put in some content,
And then I throw it back as a gimmick,
The fact is this,
I'll end up dating actresses,
Wake up on dirty mattresses,
I think I need to practice this,
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative,
World's on my shoulders,
I don't even know what Atlas is,
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is,
I'm back to rapping back to back,
Cause I've been practising,
I'm back to sing this, yes.

Chorus:
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you.

You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me, man.

Verse 6:
I'll keep my last name forever,
Keep this genre pretty basic,
Gonna be breaking into other people's tune,
When I chase it,
And replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift,
Into another rapper's shoes, using new laces,
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack,
Aiming for the papers,
Selling CD's from my rucksack,
Aiming for the majors,
Nationwide tour with Just Jack,
Still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache,
I hit back when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago,
But, more people hear me, though,
According to the Myspace and Youtube videos,
I'm always doing shows, If I'm not I'm in the studio,
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio,
Melody music maker,
Reading all the papers,
They say I'm up and coming,
Like I'm fucking in an elevator.

Chorus:
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you.

You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
 

 Song title is   Lego House (Gosling Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I feel like I had plastic surgery, cause today I looked in the mirror an' realised I'm faced with neglection,
Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant,
Stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception,
Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking how come I didn't even get a mention?,
Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension,
I signed to music for twenty-three years, now I'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension,
I'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension,
Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception,
Ah, no bars, get it?,
Now I'm choking, no bars, get it?,
It turned cloudy, no stars, get it?,
I hit the ground so hard, headache,
Ah, it's mad,
I should be proud right now but I'm sad,
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad.

(Ed Sheeran),
Hook:
I'm out of touch, in a cold December,
Now,
Keep Me Warm,
I'm out of sight,
With all these things I've done,
Don't hold me down,
It's more than I can take,
Now,
I'm out of sight,

I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton,
(Wow),
I text her, you dissed it. She don't reply like it's none of my business,
My mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit,
Why'd you do me so wicked? Something must've happened, how did I miss this?,
Love turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness (help),
Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with Misfits,
I guess I'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets,
Ah, FREE, nobody understands but me,
I don't think I got no-one but myself, so when I'm broke I still say I got P,
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad,
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad.

Verse 3:
So many thoughts battle me, got me holding my head in agony,
Trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality,
So many turning their back on me,

It's slowly coming back to me,
All I can see is the word tragedy, but I didn't think there was a fatality,
Uh, damn, I think I know why I don't see my dad,
I think I know why my mum walks past,
And why me and my girlfriend don't chat,
See, all this time I thought I was mad,
I know why I'm not proud and why I'm sad,
I'm out of sight and touch, cause back in March I don't think I survived that crash.

 Song title is   Family by Ed Sheeran:
Intro: Ed Sheeran:
Hmm, let me go,
To see my family,
Please, Father, let me go,
As my mother sleeps.

Verse 1: P Money:
I don't know about James bond,
But round here nobody lives twice,
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye,
Cause only a judge can give you life,
This is my advice,
Trust me, I nearly lost my life,
3 weeks after I got this ride,
Pissed like I had way too much wine,
Wished I didn't get one,
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set,
Even though I didn't have a set one,
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one,
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one,
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,
Then I was off to the next one,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,
Tired, but I kept on going,
Fell asleep without even knowing,
No motion in my face,
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going,
Woke up, lorry, flash,
Panic, break, skid, crash,
Skidded more, bang, smash,
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch,
I was in so much pain,
Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini,
When I was still on the first lane,
Baffled, didn't even know my name,
Fainted, too much shock in my brain,
Surrounded by paramedics and feds,
Trying to get up but fainted again,

See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out,
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out,
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go.

Bridge: Ed Sheeran:
To see my family,
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps,
Save my soul,
Please, Father, let me go,
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.

Verse 2: P Money:
Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
I could hear voices and my phone ringing,
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,
One of the worst situations I've been in,
I could hear all of the angels singing,
But when they stopped humming,
My brain turned on, started running,
Still in pain, but it started numbing,
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning,
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming,
But I was left with a permanent problem,
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly),
Ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running,
I used the first aid kit like a drum set,
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming,
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
You can't afford to let one in,
Never done tunes for a while,
The pipeline was blocked,
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing,
They say tomorrow never dies,
But they forgot to tell you, you can,
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam,
You can try beg for another,
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,
Thinking I just wanna see my brother,
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up,
Hook:.

To see my family,
And keep it inside,

 Song title is   2step (Finnish Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's got to change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran, with Ellinoora:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,

 Song title is   Wake Me Up (Live at the Bedford) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
On the last few days of LA, I got taken into this guy's house and he was sponsored by an alcohol company---quite a few actually---and uh-- got pretty wasted, umm-- all times and I was sitting underneath a tree with my phone just putting in lyrics, Bah! This is how I feel. Bah! And uh... I came up with this song and it is called Wake Me Up,
Because I was really pissed, it is quite silly. Bear that in mind.

Verse 1:
I should ink my skin with your name,
And take my passport out again,
And just replace it,
See I could do without a tan,
On my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle,
And I should run you a hot bath,
Fill it up with bubbles.

Cause maybe you're loveable,
Maybe you're my snowflake,
And your eyes turn from green to gray,
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place,
And you should never cut your hair,
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder.

Chorus:
And you will never know,
Just how beautiful you are to me,
But maybe I'm just in love,
When you wake me up,
You might also likeVerse 2:
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me,
Could you make me a cup of tea,
To open my eyes in the right way,
And I know you love Shrek,
Because we've watched it 12 times,
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too,
And if your DVD breaks today,
You should've got a VCR,
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say.

I know I've always been shit at computer games,
Because your brother always beats me,
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV,
And then you laugh at me,
And be asking me,
If I'm gonna be home next week,
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep,
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets.

Chorus:
And you will never know,
Just how beautiful you are to me,
But maybe I'm just in love,
When you wake me up,
Verse 3:
And I think you hate the smell of smoke,
You always try to get me to stop,
But you drink as much as me,
And I get drunk a lot,
So I take you to the beach,
And walk along the sand,
And I'll make you a heart pendant,
With a pebble held in my hand,
And I'll carve it like this necklace,
So the heart falls where your chest is,
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach,
And it falls just where it needs to be,
And rests peacefully,
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now,
Against yours now,
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up.

Interlude: (Gyptian - Hold Yuh):
Girl me wann fi hold yuh,
Put me arms right around ya,
Girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life,
Girl me just wann fi  squeeze yah,
Put me arms right around ya,
Girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life,
Oh in my life, oh,
Oh in my life, oh,
Oh in my life, ooh oh,
Outro:
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up,
 

 Song title is   Miss You by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Shock, horror, I’m down, lost, you’re not around,
There’s a lump in my chest that sends cold through my head, and,
My mind shuts sound out,
I’m on auto-pilot, and my tongue's gone silent,
Just switch it off and lay it down,
Lay it down, next to you and me.

Hook 1:
I don’t know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine, woah,
I don’t know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say,
That I miss you and I miss you.

Verse 2:
These words mean nothing to me,
I’m just sitting on a fence of how it used to be,
These three words are aching, constrict and suffocating,
My mind is racing with the picture I’m painting,
And my belly’s sick to its stomach,
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down,
When you lay down next to me.

Hook 2:
I don’t know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine, woah,
I don’t know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say,
That I miss you, more than I let on,
I kissed you far too long,
I’ll let go as soon as you do,
See I know we’re not through,

 Song title is   Goodbye to You by Ed Sheeran:
Intro: Ed Sheeran:
Hey, can you hear me,
I just wanted to let you know, hmm.

Verse 1: Dot Rotten:
I hope you can hear what I write to you,
How could I say goodbye to you?,
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you,
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam,
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man,
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels,
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant,
3 jobs in a day,
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free,
Just locked in a cage slaving,
They said they were gold in the pavements,
But you came and saw the road to amazement,
Broke your heart,
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast,
I hope your listening right,
I still think of you every Sunday,
No one can top your chicken and rice,
Even through the darkness times,
You held us all up because your vision was bright,
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside,
You never let anyone see your heartache,
You just got on with it,
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful,
And your words you would stand strong with it,
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night,
But I was just too young to go on with it,
And there somethings I could try to do,
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you,
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you,

And of the pieces of my soul,
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time),
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one,

And will you think of me up there?,
Can I say goodbye to you?,
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face,
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?,
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh.

Verse 2: Dot Rotten:
I think you phoney,
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now,
I would be by your side when you needed me,
Instead of asking you Nan can I go out?,
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now,
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up,
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope,
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths,
I miss seeing a family, being a family,
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child,
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer,
Family problems have never been funny,
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia,
She took all our inheritance money,
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces,
I never forgive the way she betrayed us,
There ain't a big enough reason,
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing,
But I guess that everyone's different,
Or should I say no one's perfect?,
She had happiness in front of her,
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing,
Since you gone the foundations crumbled,
So building it back up is my next step,
I got all the bricks and the cement but,
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect,
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task,
Make it right, I must do,
And I ask cause I trust you,
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you,
Hook 1:
And of the pieces of my soul,
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time),
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one,
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?,
Can I say goodbye to you?,
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face,
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?,
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh.

Verse 3: Ed Sheeran:
It's just for now so I should hush,
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you, oh how I miss you,
It's just for now so I should hush,
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you, oh how I miss you.

Verse 4: Dot Rotten:
There ain't enough words to describe,
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused,
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood,
We were young and he said it was raping his broad,
And for the day police came to the door,
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth,
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn,
I never been able to say this before,
Cause I was so inconsiderate,
You loved me unconditionally,
And I took advantage of it like a idiot,
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with,
I really hope that you can forgive me,
You going away was a punishment,
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me,
But I still fight the emotions within me,
Hook 2: Ed Sheeran:
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?,
And can I say goodbye to you?,
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?,
And can I say goodbye to you?,
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?,
Can I say goodbye to you?,
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face,
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?,
Can I say goodbye to you?,

Oui, mais on est séduits l'un par l'autre, chérie,

Alors on cède aux vices sans trop discuter,

On s'est rien promis, on s'aime pour mieux s'quitter.

You that build the big guns,
You that build the death planes,
You that build all the bombs,
You that hide behind walls,
You that hide behind desks,
I just want you to know,
I can see through your masks.

Verse 2:
You that never done nothin',
But build to destroy,
You play with my world,
Like it’s your little toy,
Put a gun in my hands,
And you hide from my eyes,
And you turn and run farther,
As the fast bullets fly.

Verse 3:
Like Judas of old,
You lie and deceive,
A war can be won,
You want me to believe,
But I see through your eyes,
And I see through your brain,
Like I see through the water,
That runs down my drain,

While the young people’s blood,
Flows out of their bodies,
And is buried in the mud.

Verse 5:
And you’ve thrown the worst fear,
That can ever be hurled,
Fear to bring children,
Into the world,
For threatening my baby,
Unborn and unnamed,
Well, you ain't worth the blood,
That runs in your veins.

Verse 6:
How much do I know,
To talk out of turn,
You might say that I’m young,
You might say I’m unlearned,
But there’s one thing I know,
Though I’m younger than you,
Even Jesus would never,
Forgive what you do,
Verse 7:
Let me ask you one question,
Is your money that good?,
Will it buy you forgiveness,
Do you think that it could?,
Well, I think you will find,
When your death takes its toll,
All the money you made,
Will never buy back your soul.

Verse 8:
And I hope that you die,
And your death'll come soon,
And I'll follow your casket,
In the pale afternoon,
And I’ll watch as you’re lowered,
Down to your deathbed,
And I’ll stand over your grave,
To make sure that you’re dead.

Outro:
Cool,
He's an intense guy, isn't he?,

 Song title is   Radio by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: JME:
Hi, my name is JME,
There was a time when radio played me,
'Cause my music came from my heart,
It was real to me, but now it's a par,
I'm here struggling, keeping it real,
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal,
Sometimes I sit back and think,
JME just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill,
The reason I started making music is the exact same,
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear,
I didn't go through all of that for this,
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is,
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different?,
Look at me, determined, man on a mission,
My music is me, and I am my music,
So like it or lump it, I'ma do this.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
I never had a playlist in my heart (Oh, woah, oh),
Now I need an A list just to chart (Oh, woah, oh),
But I've been famous from the start (Oh, woah, oh),
How am I gonna make my mark? Oh, oh.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & JME:
Are you gonna play me though?,
This song was never meant for the radio,
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing,
And I don't have time for a playlist,
And how much will you pay me though,
If this song was not a hit on the radio?,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Thank God for night clubs and the raves,
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves,
Unless we water it down,
But cordial music is boring me now,
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is,
Or in this music scene, what your role is,
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer,
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears,
See, I'm just telling you the truth,
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth,
You won't hear me on the radio,
But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof,
Why is that? What's going on there?,
To tell you the truth, I don't really care,
I am my music, my music is me,
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
I never had a playlist in my heart (Oh, woah, oh),
Now I need an A list just to chart (Oh, woah, oh),

Bridge: Ed Sheeran:
I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial,
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile,
So won't you hear me out?,
Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club,
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub,
So won't you hear me out?.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & JME:
Are you gonna play me though?,
This song was never meant for the radio,

 Song title is   Galway Girl (Martin Jensen Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar,
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar,
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?,
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?,
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun,
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun,
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar,
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance.

Chorus:
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said, Baby, I just want to dance,
I just want to dance,
I just want to dance,
I just want to dance,
I just want to dance,
With my pretty little Galway Girl,
You're my pretty little Galway Girl,
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl.

Verse 2:
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool,
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room,
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool,
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes,
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet,
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat,
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week,
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me,

Verse 3:
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time,
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine,
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine,
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night,
I walked her home then she took me inside,
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine,
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write,
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night.

Verse 1:
I found a love for me,
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead,
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet,
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me,
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,
Not knowing what it was,
I will not give you up this time,
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own,
And in your eyes, you're holding mine.

Chorus1:
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song,
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath,
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight,
Darling, you look perfect tonight.

Verse 2:
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know,
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home,
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets,
To carry love, to carry children of our own,
We are still kids, but we're so in love,
Fighting against all odds,
I know we'll be alright this time,
Darling, just hold my hand,
Be my girl, I'll be your man,
I see my future in your eyes,

Verse 1: Dot Rotten & Scrufizzer:
Right now it's the millitant spot with Fizzer and Dot,
We've got a villainous plot to make billions watch,
Bringing the hot flows skipping across,
Delivering some of the illest bars, killing them off,
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah we're doing the damn thing,
Man think we need them but onna that thing,
Nah I'm back in this raptures, double my ad-libs,
Got them all banging the anthems having a madness,
For me the music's the thorn in my vein,
Calling my name, yeah, we're lord of the raves,
I swear down I got them all talking my name,
Been working all year it's the ultimate gain,
Uh, look I don't need you making us angry, we were so peaceful,
You don't really wanna see us get so lethal, any foe to approach,
Will be ghosted and don't be fooled, yes, people.

Even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes,
Many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic,
Setting it alight, come up with the energy and vibe,
Feel like I'm back from a coma, stronger than ever,
Songs are forever so I'm living longer than ever,
Any genre, whatever, I'll be setting off a bomb,
Cause my longevity's just too long for a measure,
Well I'm setting off better, I'm taking over faster,
Showering down, you better put your umbrella on,
Yeah I'm stepping up a level, got my foot on the pedal,
I'm coming to be the better vision than ?: when I'm spitting,
They had to resist because they need a stage to perform,
Case and a cord, you won't see me pace through the door,
Thinking I'm gonna be rich so I'm chasing the Forbes,
Spreading like a plague, songs getting played when I ?:.

As if I went crazy in a whip crashing the ride,
Double P when we enter that's passion and pride,
They ain't gotta life cause they let that battery die,
I'm a shooting star that ain't catching your eye,
An assassin with lines and immaculate rhymes,
They all say they're the truth but it's actually lies,
So we hit them with a punch like a Cassidy line,
Yeah I tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside,
Raging like I stand on the right, yeah my stamina is high,
Yeah I'm living like I stand with the Mayans,
So think twice cause our plans are defiant,
It's blatant you need me, who's this face on the TV?,
Come on, we're taking it easy,
Got kids in the school exchanging the CD,
Love hearing the bars, impatient to cheer me.

 Song title is   Nightmares by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Random Impulse:
They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep,
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see,
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease,
To the retrieve then I can't let them be,
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17,
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green,
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's ever been,
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen,
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be,
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing,
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me,
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me,

And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze,
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em,
Married to the game was a quiet wedding,
And I had to fight to get her, I am tekken (taking),
Control of my inception,
Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection,
See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back,
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them,
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish,
Cause the haters know where the family lives,
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger,
Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did,
They say sleep is the cousin of death,
But I ain't hearing that shh... cousin, I'm—,
Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n),
I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next (Sway).

Verse 3: Wretch 32:
They're watching me, they watch me sleep,
Let me go,
I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity,
I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow,
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed,
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep,
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat,
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep,
See, all the dreams I'm fond of,
You placed me in the team insomnia,
Now, I'm Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance, worst luck,
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner,
Yeah, but I walked from that ish,
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress.

And when my dreams are sleeping,

 Song title is   You by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Wiley:
The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid,
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit,
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it,
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?,
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones,
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones,
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum,
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots,
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?,
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love,
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above,
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up,
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan,
No one here to save the day now you're all alone,
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth,
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone.

Hook: Ed Sheeran:
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when,
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you,
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you.

Verse 2: Wiley:
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile,
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind,
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say Yes Nan,
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying Yes Nan,
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one,
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like,
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like,
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write,
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine,
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die,
And when I'm gone I want my music to play,
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry,
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made,
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly,
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it,
I work round the clock I don't stop at night,

 Song title is   Balance by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Perfect time to be trying,
But we need to wait and read between the lines,
Stay inside, the windows dying,
I don't want to see the sadness in your eyes,
You could say we got a long way to go,
I won't,
'Cause when tomorrow comes you'll never know,
You know.

Pre-Chorus:
And even though we're waiting on a miracle,
Well, I believe in us,
Just be here with me and turn the world off,
And that will be enough.

Chorus:
We could take a day, imagine it,
Make paper planes and fly,
Stare off into space,
Go to a place that all the hurt will die,
Balance, all in everything,
Balance, see what the dawn brings.

Chours:
Stage fright, need direction,
Every second wasted is a little lie,
Your mood is my reflection,
And though I get it wrong, you know I really try,
Everyone around us seems to know,
What we don't,
Maybe in a week, it'll be exposed,
Let's hope,

 Song title is   2step (Italian Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,
And all we need is us to go all,

Verse 2: Ultimo:
Quando mi dai poco voglio troppo da te, però,
Quando mi dai troppo non capisco cos'è,
Vorrei sparire di botto,
Come la pioggia d'agosto,
Poi dimostrarti che torno,
In fondo l'amore è il ritorno, però,
Siediti che ti racconto,
Come si può nella vita stare in piedi,
Senza che nessuno paghi per te il conto,
Ed esser oggi quel che tu sognavi ieri?,
Come ho fatto a non vederlo nei miei occhi,
Che ho già dentro quel che io cercavo fuori?,
Dai, sarà che c'ho il destino in tasca,
E lo decido io se un giorno questo cambia.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Ultimo, Both:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,

 Song title is   Drown Me Out by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ghetts:
I'm in so deep,
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real,
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it,
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill,
Keeping my head above water,
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner,
So I move with the force of a sorcerer,
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow,
And I'm parro, running out of ammo,
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow,
The less then the better,
More proof for the last one left,
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella,
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?,
How can I be at my best with this pressure?,
I've got a lot to lose,
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror,
No wonder I'm under stress,
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds,
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave,
And invited more than a hundred guests,
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence,
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda,
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back,
Back to 15, ?:
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat,

You won't drown me out, out, out,
You won't drown me out.

Verse 2: Ghetts:
You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low,
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone,
I've never seen someone drown without,
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs,
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch,
Do I sound like I'm choking?,
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating,
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean,
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining,
Plain sailing, no commotion,
Like a dolphin when it's in motion,
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?,
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion,
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open,
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon,
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you,
Arm for arm, eye for eye,
I just want to live my life,
But they don't want to see this guy survive,

When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes,
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive.

Our hearts were never broken,
And time's forever frozen, still.

Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans,
Holding me close until our eyes meet,

Wait for me to come home.

 Song title is   Fear by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Is this a joke that no one's laughing at?,
Throwing good energy after bad,
Take the credit and then, fade to black,
I guess this time it's going outside,
You take the beating they give,
But you didn't do anything criminal,
They live in a bubble that nothing can penetrate,
Never allowing to slip at all.

Pre-Chorus:
You're only human, they bleed just like you do,
And you're not immune to their ridicule,
If they have a thought, don't mean that it's right,
Because they said out loud now.

Chorus:
Fear is a joykiller, so fuck what they say,
No winnеr, lost spirit from words on our page,
They only say you can't do when thеy can't do it,
Don't let it get to you, babe,
Fear is a joykiller, so fuck what they say.

Verse 2:
Don't let the dark around us get to you,
You were born incredible and free,
A wise one can argue or respect a fool,
From far away it's difficult who you see,
You keep your mouth shut,
Head down trying to deal with all the subliminals,
Avoid any trouble, don't give in to the hate,
You cannot play by their hidden rules,

 Song title is   The City (Live at Sticky Studios) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
This city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it’s late,
And sirens bleed through my windowsill,
I can’t close my eyes,
Don’t control what I’m into,
And this tower is alive,
The lights that blind keep me awake,
My hood up and lace untied,
Sleep fills my mind,
Don’t control what I’m into.

Pre-Chorus:
London calls me a stranger, a traveller,
This is now my home, my home.

Chorus:
I’m burning on the back street,
Stuck here sitting in the backseat,
And I’m blazing on the street,
What I do isn’t up to you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two.

Verse 2:
The pavement is my friend,
It will take me where I need to go,
So I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I’m used to,
And the shop across the road,
Fulills my needs and gives me company,
When I need it,
Voices speak through my walls,
I don’t think I’m gonna make it,
Past tomorrow,

And my lungs hurt,
And my ears bled,
With the sound of the city life,
Echoed in my head,
Do I need this,
To keep me alive?,
The traffic stops and starts, but I,
Need to move along.

Verse 3:
I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease,
Pollution in the air matches that on the street,
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like,
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like,
I was a country boy when I moved out,
Grew up too fast for my family to find out,
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives,
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies,
This city won’t erase me,
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me,
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but,
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from,
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now,
Knees weak, but we never slow down,
Now I start to do my music properly,
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me,
Pre-Chorus:
And London calls me a stranger,
This is not my home, home.

Chorus:
Burning on the back street,
Stuck here sitting in the backseat,
And I’m blazing on the street,
What I do isn’t up to you,

Stuck here sitting in the backseat,
And I’m blazing on the street,
What I do isn’t up to you,
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two,
 

 Song title is   You Break Me by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree,
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast,
The tide is high but we swam in too deep,
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece,
You can take away all this mess,
And I could never think anything less of you.

Hook 1:
‘Cos you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me,
This pain has outrun me,
You are all I have left.

Verse 2:
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms,
To spur this on we left that room too long,
You open wide and all the lies flow out,
To eat you whole,
But we both know that you’re too cold,
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies,
And show you there’s no surprise in me’.

Hook 2:
Well still, you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me,

Verse 1:
Goodbye Norma Jeane,
Though I never knew you at all,
You had the grace to hold yourself,
While those around you crawled,
They crawled out of the woodwork,
And they whispered into your brain,
They set you on the treadmill,
And they made you change your name.

Chorus:
And it seems to me you lived your life,
Like a candle in the wind,
Never knowing who to cling to,
When the rain set in,
And I would've liked to have known you,
But I was just a kid,
Your candle burned out long before,
Your legend ever did.

Verse 2:
Loneliness was tough,
The toughest role you ever played,

And pain was the price you paid,
Even when you died,
Oh the press still hounded you,
All the papers had to say,
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude,

To me there’s only up, there ain’t no point in looking down,
However hard I try, I only get weaker,
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold.

Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar,
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark,
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody,
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block,
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?,
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy,
With my head in the sky,
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die,
So see the signs, stand to the side,
Open your eyes and take a look and realise,
The resurrection's arrived,
And as the mist clears, homie I arise,
From my tomb in disguise,
I'm all alone, Alonestar,

Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move,

Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder,
It don't matter to me,
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely,
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?,
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?.

 Song title is   2step (Spanish Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the prеssure on, you're bound to break, somеthing's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,
And all we need is us to go all,

Verse 2: Quevedo:
Otra noche que no duermo imaginando que tu vida sin mí sería más fácil,
Otros concierto', otras ciudade', otra dosi',
Otro intento que va a quedar en un casi,
Dejando el móvil encendido por si,
Llama' para preguntar qué tal me van todo' mis male',
Dime si piensas en mí cuando por la' noche' sale',
Que yo cancelo lanzamiento' y festivale',
Por ti-i-i-i, i-i-i-i-i-i,
Vuelvo a la isla que nos vio crecer,
A recordarme que por ti fue por que empecé.

 Song title is   Get Over It by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Started off with one kiss, standing in a red dress,
Silhouette the sunset, ripple in the breeze,
Finished with a book, and saying better off friends,
Even though you weren't friends before you'd ever meet.

Pre-Chorus:
Lovers to strangers, watch how it changes,
It's such a shame to end like this,
To end like this,
Get over this.

Chorus:
I know we failed, at least we tried,
Oh, I, I know we did,
Yeah, your words will bruise my pride,
Tonight it stings a bit,
In a losing state of mind,
I cry, Is that all there is?,
And it hurts to say goodbye,
But I'll get over it.

Verse 2:
Shouting from a sentence, but it's not the way you meant it,
Should have given more attention into the little red lights,
I no longer know you, I used to love the old you,
But I guess I should have told you way before tonight,

Bridge:
One day there will be someone else in your life,
And I know my love it can't be helped tonight,
I knew you better than I know myself, but it's time,
Yeah, it's time to get over it.

 Song title is   Don’t/Loyal/No Diggity/The Next Episode/Nina by Ed Sheeran:
These are the song lyrics for song #742:
 -away pizza,
Before a text message was the only way to reach her,
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her,
Singing out Aretha,
All over the track like a feature,
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either,
But me and her we make money the same way,
Four cities, two planes the same day ah,
Those shows have never been what it's about,
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out,
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch,
But we should get on a plane,
Or we'll be missing it now,
I wish I'd have written it down,
The way that things played out,
When she was kissing him how,
I was confused about,
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing,
Ah lah.

Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Ah lah,
Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Ah lahmlahlah,
(knock, knock, knock),
On my hotel door,
I don't even know if she knows what for,
She was crying on my shoulder,
I already told ya,
Trust and respect is what we do this for,
I never intended to be next,
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all,
And I never saw him as a threat,
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course,
It's not like we were both on tour,
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor,
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different,
This is not the way you realise what you wanted,
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest,
All this time God knows I'm singing,
Ah lah.

Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Ah lah,
Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Ah lah,
Don't fuck with my love,
These girls ain't loyal,
That heart is so cold,
This girl ain't loyal,
Ah lah.

Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Ah lahmlahlah.

Shorty get down, good Lord,
Baby got 'em open all over town,
Strictly biz she don't play around,
Cover much grounds,
Got game by the pound,
Getting paid is her forte,
Each and every day true player way,
I can't get her outta my mind (say what),
I think about the girl all the time,
East side to the west side,
Push your fat rides it's no surprise,
She got tricks in the stash,
Stacking up the cash,
Quick when it comes to the gas,
By no means average,
She's on when she's got to have it,
Baby you're a perfect 10,
I wanna get in,
Lemmi get down so I can win, sing it.

I like the way you work it (no diggity),

I met you when I was a teen,
But then you were one as well,
And I could play a guitar,
Just like ringing a bell,
Sometimes I wonder,
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover,
To me listening to Stevie Wonder,
Under the covers where we used to lay,
And re: stacks is what the speakers played,
I'd be on tour almost every day,
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay.

Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed,
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe,
We used each other's air just for the people to see,
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep,
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us,
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up,
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause,
We can all be loved the way that God made us,
And time's the only reason that we could break up,
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much,
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane,
Or make a mistake, say it again.

Oh Nina,
You should go Nina,
'Cause I ain't never coming home,
Nina oh, won't you leave me now,
And I've been living on the road Nina,
But then again you should know Nina,
Cause that's you and me both,
Nina oh, won't you leave me now,
Now.

And every weekend in the winter,
You'd be wearing my hoodie,
With draw strings pulled tight,
To keep your face from the cold,
Taking day trips to the local,
Where we'd eat on our own,
Cause every day when I was away,
We'd only speak on the phone.

Watching Blue Planet,
Creating new habits,
Then as if we were two rabbits,
And then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics,
I disappear,
You call me selfish, I understand,
But I can't help it,
I put my job over everything,
Except my family and friends,
But you'll be in between forever,
So I guess we'll have to take a step back,
Overlook the situation,
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications,
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break,
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late,
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane,
But in a day we'll have to say it again.

Oh Nina,
You should go Nina,
'Cause I ain't never coming home,
Nina oh, won't you leave me now,
And I've been living on the road Nina,
But then again you should know Nina,
Cause that's you and me both Nina,
Uh won't you leave me now,
Now.

Love will come and love will go,
But you can make it on your own,
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now,
People grow, and fall apart,
But you can mend your broken heart,
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now.

Oh Nina,
You should go Nina,
'Cause I ain't never coming home,
Nina oh, won't you leave me now,
And I've been living on the road Nina,
And then again you should know Nina,
Cause that's you and me,
Both in a road, won't you leave me now,
Now,

Already sick of what you're saying,
Hoping now I'm only praying,
My baby's gone away,
And I've already packed my bags.

Hook:
You didn't know me,

You couldn't show me,
(What you have to say?),
My one and only,
Has gone away,
Far away.

Verse 2:
You'll never leave me alone,
Now I'm off on my own,
I'll never ring your phone again,
And still you keep on crying,
If I said I loved you, I'd be lying,
You need to dry your eyes,
And I've still got to pack my bags,

 Song title is   2step (German Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
    Two-,
Intro: reezy:
Two-steppin' with the woman I love, love,
Yeah, los gehts, los gehts.

Verse 1: Ed Sheeran, reezy, Both:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep (Wasn't that deep),
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now (We forget).

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,
And all we need is us to go all,

Verse 2: reezy:
All we need is love,
Doch liebe fällt so schwer bei den Problemen in mein' Kopf (Kopf),
PTSD hält mich wach am Block,
Mein Herz ist 26, meine Seele 52 (Yeah),
Ich weiß, nicht alles, was ich mache, ist vernünftig (No),
Du warst so wie Weed, wir kannten uns nur flüchtig,
Doch dann wurd ich süchtig, seitdem trägt das ganze Früchte,
Mit dir halt' ich es einhundert, weil du warst immer echt (Real),
Ich hab' hundert K in Duffle-Bag (Bag),
Sie gibt mir ein'n Haargummi, ich pack's um die Racks,
Ich weiß, spar'n wär nicht schlecht, doch.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,

Intro:
Yeah.

Verse 1:
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no,
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control,
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes,
And tonight had something wonderful.

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone,
Conversations with a stranger I barely know,

 Song title is   You Need Me by Ed Sheeran:
These are the song lyrics for song #753:
 -writer,
You're just bluffing,
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing,
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School,
I came fast with the way I act, right,
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe.

And I won't be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia,
And musically I'm demonstrating,
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating,
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me,
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi.

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you.

You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me,
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right,
I won't stop till my name's in light,
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice,
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights,
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice,
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper,
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter,
The games over but now I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal.

People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows,
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch,
So you can read the lyrics when I'm singing them out,
Wow.

From day one, I've been prepared,
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair,
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds,
Cause it's another day,
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic.

Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it,
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Into another rappers shoes using new laces,
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers,
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors,
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache,
I hit back when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago,
But more people hear me though,
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos,
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio,
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio,
Melody music maker,
Reading all the papers,
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator,
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you.

You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,

 Song title is   I’m Glad I’m Not You by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
It’s been a while since we were here,
Been too long my fear is,
Holding back the memories of your eyes,
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left for  me,
All that’s left is shattered hearts,
It’s plain enough for us to see that,
You’ve got me,
You’ve got me.

Hook:
We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends,
I feel it coming around again,
Let me know where you let your heart go,
And I will just pretend,
That I have never felt this way,
Since you I have never felt this way,
Since you,
I feel strange,
Playing games,
It’s no fuss,
I’m not in love.

Verse 2:
Twisted tunes, a melody of spite,
If you give me the words then I might,
Let go unknown feelings,
Telling me that I cannot fight,
When you speak that shite,
Let go unknown feelings,
Telling me that,
You’ve got me,
You’ve got me,

Your words make me whole,
But your scars demand a healer’s touch,

Chorus: :
You look so perfect standing there,

Hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Verse 2: :
Let’s get out, let’s get out,
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down,

And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it,
Would you wanna run away too?,

 Song title is   Way Home by Ed Sheeran:
    Well I once heard a story 'bout a run-,
Chorus:
Well I once heard a story 'bout a run-down home,
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone,
He tried to live, no effort was shown,
He's slowly finding a way back home.

Verse:
He had a nice family with smiles and frowns,
They never could solve his way to be down,
'Cause he's one dog who don't want a bone,
He's slowly finding a way back home,
He had a nice house with windows and doors,
He said to his wife What's mine is yours,
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown,
He's slowly finding a way back home,
His children have left but the rooms are still there,
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair,
But far from the nest the babies have flown,
He's slowly finding a way back home,
His wife was an angel sent from above,
He never returned her kisses or love,
But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown,
This man who's finding a way back home,
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June,
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon,
He stares at the floor, no more to roam,
He's slowly finding a way back home,

And they scream,
The worst things in life come free to us.

Chorus 1:
Cause she's just under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple of grams,

Verse 1:
I felt the fall on my breast,
At the bottom of my stomach,
She put my hand on her chest,
While she looked into my eyes,
You rescued me,
And called up these words in threes,
And you know I can’t forget it,
And 10 months on you liberate truth,
See, I was wrong on how I hate you,
And it’s the worst thing that I did.

Hook:
When I read through you,
You weren’t translated,
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages,
So I’d be free from it.

Verse 2:
See, all this truth sparks lies in me,
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy,
The key is just to ignore,

Well I walked from my house to yours,
In a warm cold April rain,
We barely went outdoors,
And your family took the blame,
Take time to be with you,
She can only glare,
I’m a bad influence, that’ll do,
‘Cos I need to cut my hair,
Wash my mouth, change my clothes,
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours,
Tell them not to come here anymore,
Time to go, don’t be slow,
This’ll only take a mo’,
Take yourself right out of my door.

Hook:
It’s just that they don’t care,
Dad said beware, watch your back,
Just don’t reply to that woman there,
And even if she makes a fuss,
Just ignore that trust,
And don’t give in to lust,
And leave that one alone,
The girl’s trouble,

Cleaner lives are what you don’t see,
Fell the weight, gravitate,
Feel the pace of me,
This world is 2D,
The only thing that’s free in life is love,
And that don’t come cheap,

I know we're bigger than a picture or a silly caption,
I like you in real life, I'm bendin' over backwards,
And love the way you love me, I find you so attractive,
Flight mode, we don't need no distractions,
And we ain't walkin' down the street unless you hold my handgun,
Maybe I'm just a schmuck who really can't believe his luck,
But he's just hopin' he's enough, feel like me, we had it hard,
So we learned to adjust and take thе smooth with the rough,
Your skin's smooth to the touch, I got juice in my cup,
Shе know I ain't like them fools in the club,
I'm grindin' so we got a house on the hill,
A boat for the cane and a pool for the a tub,
'Til then I'm two-steppin' in the mud.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,
And all we need is us to go all,

Night, night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
Night, yeah,
All we need is us.

Verse 2: Ed Sheeran:
What do you reckon, is it just me?,
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep,
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart,
If you don't see it, you should trust me,
I feel like I got nothin' left right now,
Except this beauty in her dress right now,
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs,
So we press play and step to the beat.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
Head out to the place where it plays and.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved,
And all we need is us to go all,
Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
Night, night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
Night, yeah,
All we need is us to go all night,
Night, night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
Night, yeah,
All we need is us to go all night,

 Song title is   The City (Live at the Bedford) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
This city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it's late,
Sirens bleed through my windowsill,
I can't close my eyes,
Can't control what I'm into,
This tower is alive,
The lights that blind keep me awake,
With my hood up and lace untied,
Sleep fills my mind,
Can't control what I'm into.

Pre-Chorus:
London calls me a stranger,
A traveler,
This is now my home, my home.

Chorus:
I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
And if the city never sleeps,
Then that makes two.

Verse 2:
The pavement is my friend,
And it will take me where I need to go,
I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I'm used to,
The shop across the road,
Fulfills my needs and gives me company,
When I need it,
Voices speak through my walls,
I don't think I'm gonna make it,
Past tomorrow,

Bridge:
And my lungs hurt,
And my ears bled,
With the sound of the city life,
Echoed in my head,
Do I need this to keep me alive?,
The traffic stops and starts,
But I need to move along.

Rap Verse:
I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease,
Pollution in the air matches that on the street,
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like,
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like,
I was a country boy when I moved out,
Grew up too fast for my family to find out,
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives,
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies,
This city won’t erase me,
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me,
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but,
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from,
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now,
Knees weak, but we never slow down,
Now I start to do my music properly,
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me,
Pre-Chorus:
London calls me a stranger,
This is not my home, home.

Chorus:
I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
And if the city never sleeps,
Then that makes two.

Chorus:

That was fun!,

 Song title is   Diary by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Your love is the strongest thing I know,
I reckon it's been doing weights,
Eating raw eggs in its cereal,
And running ten miles a day,
And your love has a driving ban,
From trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands,
And your love is a friend of mine,
So we'll take it care tonight.

Pre-Hook:
If you could only say the words,
I'd take it and I'd write it down,
And hold it deep inside of me,
Until the day you found me out,
But I know your love,
And that's why.

Hook:
I could be your diary,
Baby if you open me up,
Keep it inside me,
I'll give you the world,
Just give me the words,
And I could be your diary,
Baby if you open me up,
Keep it inside me,

And your love,
Has never been my enemy,
Used to hold me,
And promise it would never leave,
Never been better since all the therapy,
To read the words between the lines,
And take away my melody,
And your love,
Told me it was turning to a different page,
And you know, if I let you go,
I'll still keep you safe.

Pre-Hook:.

Hook:.

Verse 3:
You are the one I fall asleep with,
But never wake up to,
Cause work is something you must do,
I trust you like you trust me,
It must mean true love,
It does exactly what it says on the tin,
Let me begin,
You are the one I watch the movies with,
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is,
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again,
But you're actually the same,
It's just to spite me,
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it,
Until the dishes finished,
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it,
I tried to make tea once for you in bed,
But all I did was spill it,
So you made it for me instead,
Let me in bed,
If you get in ahead of me,
It's better to do,
Yeah, love is ahead of the truth,
But in love,
We are better in two,
I'll be the newcomer,
Stuck in heaven with the devil in you,

    1 ContributorDon’t Explicit Version] Lyrics[Verse 1:
    I met this girl late last year,
    She said, ,
Verse 1:
I met this girl late last year,
She said, Don't you worry if I disappear,
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake,
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait,
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned,
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn,
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right,
I went away for months until our paths crossed again,
She told me, I was never looking for a friend,
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin,
We'll be in bеtween the sheets till the late AM,
Baby, if you wantеd me then you should have just said, she's singing.

Chorus:
Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe,
You might also likeVerse 2:
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her,
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza,
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her,
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her,
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature,
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either,
But, me and her, we make money the same way,
Four cities, two planes, the same day,
And those shows have never been what it's about,
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out,
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch,
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now,
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out,
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about,
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing.

Chorus:
Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't fuck with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Verse 3:
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door,
I don't even know if she knows what for,
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya,
Trust and respect is what we do this for,
I never intended to be next (You bastard),
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all,
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard),
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course,
It's not like we were both on tour,
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor,
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different,
This is not the way you realized what you wanted,
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest,
And all this time, God knows I'm singing.

Chorus:
Don't fuck with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't fuck with my love,

 Song title is   Scars by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
You've got scars on your body and your soul,
Bruises on your back now,
Broken heart with nowhere to go,
Living in a high-rise flat,
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together,
Nothing is forever you know,
You can start again like this, like this.

Chorus:
Now I see blood in the sky,
Blood in my eyesight,
And everything's turning to red,
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife,
And light me up, burn me today,
I'm seeing blood in the skyline,
Stuck in the right mind,
Afraid again to leave any dream,
And replace it with anything better,
So get up,
And take away your scars.

Verse 2:
You can never be alone if you're bleeding with the skyline,
Waiting for the right time,
When the night's already gone,
It's been traveling without your mind now,
Let it let go and fuel you like petrol,
You find so much beauty in what makes you mental,
Your friends know it's only,
A state of mind, you're only getting by,
By always getting high, that's why,

Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,

 Song title is   Insomniac’s Lullaby by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I'm getting very edgy,
'Cause you're trying to take this from me,
And it’s something that I wanted so bad,
'Cause you're the definition,
Of someone who has to ruin,
The best thing that I ever had,
'Cause you're a jealous girl, and all I can say is,
It’s your fault but partially mine (Your fault but partially mine),
For losing hope, for not treating you right,
But that will disappear in time.

Pre-Chorus:
All I gotta do is pass you by,
Never say what's wrong whenever I say Why?.

Chorus:
Standing in the corner,
Shadowed by the light,
To you I seem much smaller,
But I know it might be you,
How much better could I do,
To be myself, not someone else?,
I’m losing sleep, I live only for the week.

Verse 2:
I've grown to ignore you,
'Cause when I seem to bore you,
You pretend that you’re not interested,
Your eyes start to twinkle,
Your smile starts to widen,
And I just seem to try and forget,
But you pay me no attention,
Even though I do (Even though I do),
But I don’t care as long as you’re mine,
It’s happening every time,

Standing in the corner,
Shadowed by the light,
To you I seem much smaller,

How much better could I do,
To be myself, not someone else?,
I’m losing sleep, I live only for the week.

Bridge:
And I'm falling harder now it seems,
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams,
And I can't sleep although I think I can,
It's insomnia I think I have,
But who cares when I'm not your man?.

Verse 1:
If you wanna put this on me, that’s fine,

So can you help me out?,

So can you help me out?.

And say if you love somebody new,
So even in my mind it’s true,
Cause I have fallen for you,
Say if you love somebody new.

Verse 2:
See I wanna take her to the Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly Show,
I could have taken anyone there,

How fast I would turn an eye,
I was blind to all, yeah I saw all.

 Song title is   Castle On The Hill (Nevada Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
When I was six years old I broke my leg,
I was running from my brother and his friends,
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,
I was younger then, take me back to when I.

Pre-Chorus:
Found my heart and broke it here,
Made friends and lost them through the years,
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown,
But I can't wait to go home.

Chorus:
I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real,
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill.

Verse 2:
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes,
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends,
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right,
But I was younger then, take me back to when.

Pre-Chorus:
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid,
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight,
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown,
But I can't wait to go home,

Over the castle on the hill.

Bridge:
One friend left to sell clothes,
One works down by the coast,
One had two kids but lives alone,
One's brother overdosed,
One's already on his second wife,
One's just barely getting by,
But these people raised me,
And I can't wait to go home.

Chorus:
And I'm on my way, I still remember,
These old country lanes,
When we did not know the answers,
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real,
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,

Intro:
Ooh, ooh.

Verse 1:
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no,
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control,
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes,
And tonight had something wonderful.

Chorus:
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone,
Conversations with a stranger I barely know,
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't,
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do,
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space,
And I know I lose control of the things that I say,
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape,

 Song title is   Small Bump - Live From Wembley Stadium by Ed Sheeran:
Spoken Intro:
Now, Wembley, I've not played this song in a...,
Around two years, maybe, maybe longer,
But I feel like playing it today,
Let's see how it goes.

Verse 1:
You're just a small bump unborn,
In four months you're brought to life,
You might be left with my hair,
But you'll have your mother's eyes,
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can,
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans,
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life.

Pre-Hook:
And I'll hold you tightly,
I'll give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me,
I'll put my future in you.

Hook:
'Cause you are my one and only,
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
You are my one and only,
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
And you'll be alright,
You might also likeVerse 2:
Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin,
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin,
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice,
Eyelids closed to be soon opened wide,
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes.

Pre-Hook:
I'll whisper quietly,
I'll give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me,
I'll put my future in you.

Hook:
'Cause you are my one and only,
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
You are my one and only,
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
And you'll be alright.

Bridge:
You can lie with me,
With your tiny feet,
When you're half asleep,
I'll leave you be,
Right in front of me,
For a couple weeks,
So I can keep you safe,
Hook:
'Cause you are my one and only,
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
You are my one and only,
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb,
And hold me tight,
And you'll be alright.

Outro:
You were just a small bump unborn,
Four months then torn from life,
Maybe you were needed up there,
But we're still unaware as why,
 

 Song title is   Bonus Track by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I want to be real,
Not some conscience to myself,
The way you worship, never ending,
Some idol who's pretending to be true,
How you put upon yourself,
A man who never seems,
To answer to you words,
So go and make me over.

Chorus:
I'm a fly upon your neck,
You can't control me,
I have my words, my voice,
My strengths, my choice,
And I can cut as deep,
Just as deep as I need.

Verse 2:
Don't want your advice,
'Cause I've made up my own mind,
The way you bore me with the stories,
Of far and distant times,
I've heard it before,
So don't try that on me,
The way you worship, never-ending,
Some idol who's pretending to be true,
It could be you,
Brainwashed by the lies,
It's no surprise,
That you'd wanna waste your time,

 Song title is   Quiet Ballad of Ed by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
In shadow there lies hope,
Cut tension with a knife,
I find it hard to cope,
Stop playing with my life,
You analyse my fears,
Analyse my dreams,
Choke on burning tears,
Through my silent screams.

Pre-Chorus:
Things aren't what they seem.

Chorus:
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me,
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe,
Open doors just to take away the key,
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better.

Verse 2:
Watch me fall,
As I stumble at your feet,
Always losing in this game,
Your lies cut me deep,
And you don't even know my name,
With your consistency,
To always make me crawl,
And my durability,
Not affected at all,

Feel the pain,
On my brain,
Feel the strain,
As I start to decay,
Feel the strain,
Every passing day,
Feel the pain,
As I start to decay.

 Song title is   Pause by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
You know I got to get away,
To find some peace and sanity,
I've been playing hide-and-seek too long,
Shaking, making, everybody waking,
Setting the hi-fi bleed,
Keeping me back,
While you’re spinning my track,
That'll knock you off your feet,
Monkey see what monkey do,
But I'm a monkey telling you,
I just think that we should take a break,
Tickity-tock the clock with the hip-hop,
And Alonestar backing me up, we won’t stop,
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind,
Now let the track rewind.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
And play, let the music play,
It came, so let the music say what it feels,
Shame, shame it took too long,
To see that you were wrong,
Now turn the song back on.

Verse 2: Alonestar:
This is Alonestar coming at you with a new style,
Kicking dust, ready to bust, it's Urban Angel,
Artistic, flipping the script,
Who'd you really want to get it with? Ed and Alonestar,
We're like live wires sparking, ready to blow,
We've already sown our seeds, we're just waiting to grow, blow,
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body,
Metaphorical speech when we come and see you ducking for cover,
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock,
With Urban Angel and Alonestar and Ed, keep it locked,
Let the beat pump, drop the bass but don't stop,
We're kicking the sound, let the bass bins pound,
We're gonna roll, can you feel me now with my body?,
Get down to the sound,
It's Ed Sheeran in the place and Alonestar rising up,
We gotta rise up, I said rise up,

 Song title is   The City (Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Scorcher:
Hey, look, it's funny how the city where the Queen sleeps still ain't got clean streets,
But there ain't a day when she ain't got clean sheets,
And homeless people roll with needles,
And you've gotta pay tax when you own a vehicle,
Tube fare doubles up every two years,
And the buses upstairs is a no-go area,
The man are like pass me your mobile, hear me now,
And chew the crunch on the credit,
You can't get a roof over your head, you're stuck in the debit,
But every single month they come for the debit,
Direct action, if you don't play they,
Dive in, snatch things and they don't say,
Now the crib's vacant, victim of inflation,
The black letters turn red cause they've been patient,
And that six years' rent has just been wasted, wasted, wasted.

Hook: Ed Sheeran:
London calls me a stranger, a traveller,
This is now my home, my home,
I’m burning on the back street,
Stuck here sitting in the backseat,
I’m blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps then that makes two,
Bridge: Ed Sheeran:
And my lungs hurt and my ears bled,
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head,
Do I need this to keep me alive?,
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along.

Verse 2: Scorcher:
Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses,
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers,
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment,
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff,
The church pastor's still praying for answers,
Way too much congestion, they're charging,
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing,
But there ain't no funny side,
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time,
Stone Island jacket, keep warm,
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned,
And also mind the gap and keep calm,
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard,
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird,
So as much as I'm in love with this city,
Just maybe I've had enough of the city.

Come over and start up a conversation with just me,
And trust me I'll give it a chance now,
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox,
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like.

Pre-Chorus:
Girl, you know I want your love,
Your love was handmade for somebody like me,
Come on now, follow my lead,
I may be crazy, don't mind me,
Say, boy, let's not talk too much,
Grab on my waist and put that body on me,
Come on now, follow my lead,
Come, come on now, follow my lead.

Chorus:
I'm in love with the shape of you,
We push and pull like a magnet do,
Although my heart is falling too,
I'm in love with your body,
And last night you were in my room,
And now my bedsheets smell like you,
Every day discovering something brand new,
I'm in love with your, love with your body,
In love with your body, body, body,
In love with your body, body, body,

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate,

And how your family is doing okay,
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat,
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like.

Verse 1:
Pass me a drink,
You say it's gonna take a while,
Your consciousness sinks,
Tears from a crocodile.

Chorus:
You're wasting your time,
Giving me the speech,
You try to, don't reach,
Your smile,
You're holding your tears,
Your inside is dead,
You're eating your fears,
In a cigarette,
You've waited too long,
To finally see,
The sunshine in the rain,
Is as deep as the sea.

Verse 1:
Mr. Ruskin, come and paint my picture,
We're losing sleep 'cos we steal the week,
Now who's your best friend? Can you introduce me?,
See, I can't seem to even let you breathe.

Chorus:
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye,
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own,
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see,
That I am more than what is hiding in me.

Verse 2:
Come and show me if you can,
See I know you're me, but I can't seem to understand,
If you know me, place my hand on mine,
And we will resurrect the time,
That we lost when you left my mind,
It's psycho-paranoia disappearing in time,
Come and show me what makes you tick,
I need you to get out of my mind quick.

Chicago on a Friday night,
I was walking from a bar with a friend of mine,
We heard sirens and saw blue lights,
Right in front of us,
Seems her man took another mans life,
I can search a wrong and never make a right,
What's worst by the end of the night?,
There'll be somethin' else, somewhere else,
As the sun sets over the hills,
In Los Angeles and New York,
Somebody's tryna find a place to sleep,
But daddy's lookin for daughter down in New Orleans tonight.

Chorus:
Hey man, just one more night in America,
Hey man, just one more night in America.

Verse 2:
Miami on a Saturday night,
Drinks are flowing all around and the pad is wide,
Hope is low but the heels are high,
Yeah, this town's alive, oh, na-na,
She only wanted to feel some love,
Didn't get much when she was growin' up,
Men tried but they were never enough,
She needs somethin' else or somewhere else,
And in Vegas, someone's gamblin',
A family dream are two roads down,
Her mother lives in poverty, hopin' her soldiers on a call,
And say, Mama, I'm fine.,

Verse 1:
When your legs don't work like they used to before,
And I can't sweep you off of your feet,

And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three.

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades,
And the crowds don't remember my name,
When my hands don't play the strings the same way,

Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen,
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory.

Titim féin i ngrá leat arís is arís,
Tá rud ar intinn agam le rá.

Ó luí liomsa faoin solas ón oíche gheal,

A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan.

Véarsa 2:
Nuair atá mé níos sine is ag briseadh go mall,
Dearmad déanta ar m'ainm arís,
Gan mo lámha in ann don mhéid céanna,

Verse 1:
Could I wake up next to you,
When we're hitting double figures,
Look into your eyes,
Like I'm looking into double mirrors,
Could you make it any clearer,
Everything's such a blur,
It's not my turn,
It's hers to get hurt,
On a late night,
Coming home from way too many train rides,
Lace not as red as my face,
I'm home at the same time,
Highbury estate's fine,
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines.

Pre-Chorus:
I haven't slept for the past week,
Two hours ain't enough for me,

Take another step into the no-man's land,
And for the longest time, lady.

Singin' We Found Love in a local rave,
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say,
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray,
I told her my name, then said It's nice to meet you,
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila,
I already know if she's a keeper,
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in,
Deep shit if anybody finds out,
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now,
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch,
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth.

Before the beat kicks in again,
Can you feel it?,

Sew you heart to my sleeve,
We'll stay quiet underneath,
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep.

Feeling like you won't believe.

There's a firefly loose tonight,
Better catch it before it burns this place down,
And I lie if I don't feel so right,

 Song title is   Perfect (Robin Schulz Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I found a love for me,
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead,
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet,
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me,
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,
Not knowing what it was,
I will not give you up this time,
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own,
And in your eyes, you're holding mine.

Chorus:
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song,
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath,
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight.

Verse 2:
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know,
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home,
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets,
To carry love, to carry children of our own,
We are still kids, but we're so in love,
Fighting against all odds,
I know we'll be alright this time,

Be my girl, I'll be your man,

 Song title is   No Luck by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I'm screaming out upon my face,
Followed footsteps catch my pace,
Broken windows fall in place,
Now shattered lovers find their place,
We'd flirt,
And you'd treat me like dirt,
All the pain and the hurt,
Just to make matters worse.

Pre-Chorus:
And I see you all over him,
Irresistible sin,
When can we be the same again?,
What can I do to be making you see?,
To come out clean?,
You're better off with me.

Chorus:
We're stuck,
Taking time and wasting mine,
No luck,
Running around and crashing down,
In you I trust nevermore,

Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
My lungs are black, my heart is pure,
My hands are scarred from nights before,
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places,
I am a little insecure,
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue,
I bite my nails and tell the truth,
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates,
My skin is inked, but faded, too.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
But she loves me, she loves me,
Why the hell she love me,
When she could have anyone else?,
Oh, you love me, you love me,
Why the hell do you love me?,
'Cause I don't even love myself.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran with YEBBA:
Baby, the best part of me is you,
And lately, everything's making sense, too,
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you.

 Song title is   Two Blokes and a Double Bass by Ed Sheeran:
These are the song lyrics for song #821:
 -box detox,
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks,
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black,
You make the room’s hands laugh as they clap,
You make my mouth water with support acts,
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!,
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain’t wrong,
He’s got me singing to ‘Amerikan Folk Song’,
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry,
You gotta know your enemy,
Gotta check your distance,
Don’t talk, only whisper,
Slap the base so hard you get blisters,
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom,
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops,
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock,
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand,
This ain’t no fake, it’s music in your hand,
As you run into the centre of the crowd,
Silence falls like water,
You just wanna shout ‘Wow!’,
How did they even have the guts to do it ?,
If your name’s Nizlopi, then there ain’t much to it,
‘Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around nowYou might also lik,
 

 Song title is   Castle On The Hill (Acoustic) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
When I was six years old I broke my leg,
I was running from my brother and his friends,
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,
I was younger then, take me back to when I.

Pre-Chorus:
Found my heart and broke it here,
Made friends and lost them through the years,
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown,
But I can't wait to go home.

Chorus 1:
I'm on my way, driving at 90,
Down those country lanes, singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real,
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill.

Verse 2:
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes,
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends,
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right,
But I was younger then, take me back to when.

Pre-Chorus:
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid,
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight,
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown,
But I can't wait to go home,

And one works down by the coast,

And I can't wait to go home.

Chorus 2:

These old country lanes,
When we did not know the answers,

I found lust, but I wanna find love,
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode,
But I'm lonely, in LA.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy,
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine,

Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long,
But you never know though,
That one night stand, could just be the one, yeah.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely,
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart,

Oh misty eye of the mountain below,
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls,
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
Keep watching over Durin's sons.

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together,
Watch the flames climb high into the night,
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side.

Verse 2:
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together,
Raise a glass of wine for the last time,
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side,
Desolation comes upon the sky.

Now I see fire, inside the mountain,
I see fire, burning the trees,
And I see fire, hollowing souls,
I see fire, blood in the breeze,

And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out.

 Song title is   Lately - devlin by Ed Sheeran:
    1 ContributorLately -,
These are the song lyrics for song #825:
 - devlin LyricsI seem to find myself talking to the powers that be,
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees,
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe,
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep,
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any,
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many,
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon,
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true,
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths,
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves.

I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme,
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine,
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says,
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away,
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow,
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close.

DEVLIN,
5 o'clock with lights off,
Interview with a vampire,
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require,
I swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead,
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z,
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers,
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired,
And over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying,
Cuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game,
Its time to wage war,
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives,
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight,
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line,
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines,
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by,
You might also likeI never sleep,
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh,
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be.

The times i'm living in lately.

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth,
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out,
Deliver the raps how I flow,
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong,
But they won't slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded,
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in,
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with,
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in,
I try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows,
Some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone,
Im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow,
Opposite of sober cos I never did my homework,
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older,
I played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie,
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!,
Never die.

DEVLIN,
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge,
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes,
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move,
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen,
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!,
Im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em,
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em,
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment,
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake,
I never sleep,
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh,
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4,
The times i'm living in lately,

Come on, skinny love, just last the year,
Pour a little salt, we were never here,
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer,
I tell my love to wreck it all,
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall,
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
Right in the moment this order's tall.

Chorus:
And I told you to be patient,
And I told you to be fine,
And I told you to be balanced,

And in the morning I'll be with you,
But it will be a different kind,
And I'll be holding all the tickets,
And you'll be owning all the fines.

Chorus:
She played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said, Baby, I just want to dance.

Verse 1:
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar,
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar,
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?,
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?,
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun,
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun,
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar,
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance.

Chorus:
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,

Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat,
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week,
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me.

I'm made of clay, you shoot me down,
I'll ricochet to the ground,

And fill me in with your mouth,
And hold your tongue,

I lost my way, so help me out,
And lend your hand 'til I am found,
My voice is mute, not to be heard,
So it's up to you for you to bring those words.

 Song title is   Back At Home by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Saturday, me and my girlfriend are at a party in the West End,
And I don't really know nobody here either,
Maybe we should've stayed home,
And turned down the lights so low,
Open up a ?: Bordeaux, mmm,
And put on a jam so slow, so slow.

Pre-Chorus:
She said, All the girls here are beautiful,
But baby, no one around comes close to you,
And that's the honest truth,
Why are we even here?,
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you,
For the same reason that my eyes are too,
And that's when she made her move,
And whispered in my ear and said.

Chorus:
Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey),
Back to my apartment (Hey-ey-ey-ey),
There's no one here that I know,
So take my hand, I want to go,

Verse 2:
I'm still here with my best friend and I'm not,
Disappointed that the party,

And that's when she made her move,
And whispered in my ear and said.

Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey),

 - Deluxe Edition LyricsIf we take this bird in, with its broken leg,
We could nurse it, she said,
Come inside for a little lie down with me,
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing,
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder,
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?,
Let me hold ya, ohh.

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon,
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird.

My little bird.

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,
We could lay down, so I'm next you,
Come inside for a little home made tea,
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me,
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep,
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now,
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon,

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,

 Song title is   2step (Irish Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment,
You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed,
We forget that we're here right now.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn,
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right,
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night,
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time,
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved,
And all we need is us to go all,

Night, night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
Night, yeah,

Verse 2: Denise Chaila:
Slow down when I can't feel myself,
Looking right but knowing that there's nothing left,
So slow wine for the sour grapes,
'Cause moving on isn't up for debate,
I still wonder where the time's gone (Am I wrong?),
Sometimes I don't wanna be strong (They alarm),
With all these expectations of what I should be,
CC'd in so many threads that I can't see me,
Even when I'm struggling,
I bless my enemies so much they feel they owe me something,
Shatter pains like ceilings, even when I barely function,
It's wahala but mahalo,
Got my two-step, so the beat's the only thing I have to follow, uh.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Denise Chaila:
We'll go all night,
Two-steppin' with the woman I love,
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified,

Verse 1:
Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree,
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast,
The tide is high but we swam in too deep,
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece,
You can take away all this mess,
And I could never think anything less of you.

Hook 1:
‘Cos you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me,
This pain has outrun me,
You are all I have left.

Verse 2:
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms,
To spur this on we left that room too long,
You open wide and all the lies flow out,
To eat you whole,
But we both know that you’re too cold,
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies,
And show you there’s no surprise in me’.

Hook 2:
Well still, you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me,

Verse-1:
Standing at the bar,
And your eyes are telling me come closer,
But if you could see me dance,
There's no way that you would let me hold ya,
I feel you pulling on my hand more,
And dragging me to the dance floor,
All my inhibitions fall away,
Feel the rhythm of the track,
And telling the DJ pull it back...,
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say.

Refrain:
Softly do you feel that you could love me,
And want me,
More than anybody else,
But then again.

Chorus:
It could just be the baseline,
That made me close my eyes,

Could you come back with me tonight,
It's not the first time,
that we've been on our own,
So I'll hold you close,
And never let you go,
Verse: 2:
You can keep me on the dance floor,
But I don't wanna waste your time,
Feel the rhythm of your hips more,

Everyone but you just fades away,
Feeling the rhythm of the track,
And telling the DJ pull it back,
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say.

 Song title is   These Dreams by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I keep my hopes and dreams inside you amongst these other things,
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering,
Never been known as my government name,
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain,
And now you sit before me, with a folder holding my story,
You're my saviour with nothing on me but hope and glory,
And surely, you'll never ignore me,
'cos when the court came the court date was made to disappear for me,
You think you understand me, but never what I went through,
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you,
I take a ball point pen to play dot to dot,
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms,
Forget me not, never let me stop, you'll just sit and watch,
It's your job to be patient so you'll let me off,
So come with me take a walk on the wild side,
And see life in a day through a child's eyes.

Hook:
And these dreams are all I have to hold me,
When sleep's the only thing I want to take me away, away.

Verse 2:
Okay session's over time to get back to the classroom,
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too,
You told me I should try my best but guess what, I still find this trigonometry a head fuck,
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSEs,
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese,
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it,
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em,
Lately classmates think I'm crazy,
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey,
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it,
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do so,
After school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes,
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home,
So come with me take a walk on the wild side,
And see life in a day through a child's eyes,

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks,
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70,

Maybe just the touch of a hand,

And I just wanna tell you I am,
So honey now,
Take me into your loving arms,
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars,
Place your head on my beating heart,

Maybe we found love right where we are,
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades,
And the crowds don't remember my name,
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm,
I know you will still love me the same,
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen,
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory,
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways,
Maybe it's all part of a plan,
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes,
Hoping that you'll understand,
But baby now,
Take me into your loving arms,
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars,
Place your head on my beating heart,
I'm thinking out loud,
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh,

We are not beautiful (Beautiful).

Outro:
We are, we are, we are,
We are not beautiful,
 

 Song title is   Castle on the Hill (Throttle Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
When I was six years old I broke my leg,
I was running from my brother and his friends,
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,
I was younger then, take me back to when I.

Pre-Chorus:
Found my heart and broke it here,
Made friends and lost them through the years,
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown,
But I can't wait to go home.

Chorus:
I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real,
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill.

Verse 2:
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes,
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends,
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right,
But I was younger then, take me back to when,

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid,
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight,
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown,
But I can't wait to go home.

Chorus:
I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real,
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,

Verse 1: Ed Sheeran:
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer,
Sundown and they all come out,
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers,
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here),
Everybody's lookin' for a come up,
And they wanna know what you're about,
Me in the middle with the one I love and,
We're just tryna figure everything out.

Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves,
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah,

This is my only fear: that we become.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran:
Beautiful people,
Drop top, designer clothes,
Front row at fashion shows,

I had a bad week,
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep,
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over,
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment.

You know you take all of my stress right down,
Help me get it off my chest and out,
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us deprеssed,
We forget that wе're here right now.

Seeing through a picture behind a screen and forget to be,
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read,
I think maybe you and me,
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays,
And then we'll go all night,

What do you reckon, is it just me?,
Words and weapons, and occasionally they cut deep,
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark,
And I open my heart,
If you don't see it, you should trust me,
I feel like I've got nothing left right now,
Except this beauty in her dress right now,
She got me feeling like the best,
And the rest are just less than she needs,
So we press play and step to the beat.

'Cause we're living life at a different pace,
Stuck in a constant race,
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break,
Something's got to change,
We should just be cancelling all our plans,
And not give a damn,
Head out to the place where it plays, and we'll go all night.

 Song title is   You Need Me, I Don’t Need You (Live at iTunes Festival: London 2012) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd,
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud,
I can't, no, I won't hush,
I'll say the words that make you blush,
I'm gonna sing this now (Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow),
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists,
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures,
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me,
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy,
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me.

Chorus:
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,
You need me, man,

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell,
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell,
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing,
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing,
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School,
I came fast with the way I act, right,
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe,
And I won't be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia,
And musically I'm demonstrating,
Whenever I perform live, feels like I am meditating,
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me,
Young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi, yeah, yeah.

Chorus:
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,

Verse 3:
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it,
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music,
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?,
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, don't matter to me,
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely,
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?,
Hey, so I keep singing that,
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters,
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar,
I made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark,
Then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody,
Hennesey shots and all these fools on the block,
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?,
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy,
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die,
So see the signs, stand to the side,
Open your eyes and take a look and realize,
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears,
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar,
Urban Angel rising from the ashes,
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady.

Pre-Chorus:
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub,
Mummy, I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex, I ain't into making love,
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,
You can find me in the club, got a bottle full of bubbly,
Mummy, I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex, I ain't into making love,
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,
Chorus:
'Cause you need me, man, I don't, sing it out,
You need me, man, I don't, scream it,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't.

Bridge:
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning,
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning,
My eyes are red, I've been burning,
I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade,
My eyes are red, I've been burning,
I've been burning, burning, burning.

Verse 4:
Now where I come from, burning weed it is a habit,
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it,
'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket, I'm going to panic,
'Cause like I said where I come from, weed smoking is a habit,
We'll do da bun in the place up in the hood,
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should,
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good,
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel,
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug,
And if I start to smoke it I'm gonna turn into a thug,
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged,
Where I come from, burning weed, it is a blessing from above,
Where I come from, yes, we bun it when we listen rub a dub,
Where I come from, yes, we bun after we just-a make a love,
Where I come from, yes, we bun it when the sun starts shine,
I blaze high grade weed all the time.

Verse 5:
Welcome to Jamrock, camp whe' the thugs dem camp at,
Two pound a weed inna van back,
It inna yuh hand bag, yuh nap sack, it inna yuh back pack,
And ah give yah girlfriend contact,
Some bwoy nuh know dis, dem only come around like tourist,
On the beach with a few club sodas,
Bedtime stories, pose like dem name Chuck Norris,
And they don't know the real hardcore,
'Cause Sandals ah no Back-To, thugs dem wi' do whe' dem got to,
And won't think twice to shot you,
Don't mek dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too,
And dem don't stand a chance at all, now my eyes are red.

Chorus:
'Cause you need me, I don't need you,
You need me, man, my eyes are red,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, my eyes are red,
You need me, I don't need you,

Verse 5:
'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aiming it right,
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights,
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice,
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights,
'Cause I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice,
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper,
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah,
The game's over, but now I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal,
People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows, but,
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch,
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' 'em out,
Wow, from day one I've been prepared,
With V05 wax for my ginger hair,
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of,
What the future holds 'cause it's another day,
Close, close, close, close.

Verse 6:
I've still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with the cold flows,
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact, you don't know,
Tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant,
You can't keep up, you'll get none, you're celibate,
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin,
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in,
Do it for the hell of it,
'Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit,
I took what held me back with the women, then packaged the image,
Put in some content, then sold it back as a gimmick,
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses,
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this,
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative,
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is,
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is,
I'm back to rapping, back to back 'cause I've been practicing,
I'm back to sing this, yes.

Chorus:
You need me, man, sing it out,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, scream it,
You need,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't,
Devlin.

Verse 7: Devlin:
Yo, yo, you need me, but I dont need you,
D-E-V-L-I-N, Ed and 32,
I'm lyrically more capable to break 'em all,
I ain't gotta amputate a lower limb to make you fall,
Like autumn, check the post mortem,
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for his fortune,
I don't mean money, I mean luck,
And now the clock's aviated and everybody's time's up,
Nothing's what I had and everything is what I gave,
Like a sprinter near the finish line, fighting for his place,
Keep your diamonds and your chains,
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe,
'Cause I get respected while they get detested,
Told the truth, there ain't nobody that done what Devs did,
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9,
You ain't competition, just a fish, you're tryna bite a line.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Sway:
Sing it, you need me, man, I don't,
Make some noise for Devlin,
Sing it, you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, scream it out,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you (Yeah),
Sway.

Verse 8: Sway:
All over the radio and back up in the raves again,
We got the crowd on the wave like it's a stadium,
Call me the weather man, it's 'bout to be a great weekend,
I'm on the cloud, let's make it rain again,
Nice but naughty, shirts and dresses looking saucy,
Living in our minuses 'cause life begins at forty, level up,
Call me Bond, James Bond,
How I maintain, winner stays on,
My brain racing like I'm tryna win the gold for Britain,
I'm on a one-track mind, let's go the distance,
We're only stopping when we pose for pictures,
And now we move so wavy, we get motion sickness,
I choose if you're hearing,
Sway started rapping, now you're fearing,
Hands in the air, start screaming,
I say Ed, you say— peace, yeah.

Chorus:
You need me, man, I don't,
Make some noise for Sway and keep singing that hook, it goes,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, sing it out, sing it out,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't,
Chip.

Verse 9: Chip:
Ayy,
It's funny how money change the situations,
And miscommunication leads to complications,
Shouts to Meek Mills when your dream chasing,
The people at the back love confrontation,
Finsy Park to Tottenham Hale were my stations,
Me, Twiss, and Dredd used to bump the train,
No Victoria line, me I made a lane,
Take notes from my career and them keep the,
These kids can't test me, I'm on my grown,
Still with Sammy, I ain't on my own,
If I wear red bottoms you won't even know,
'Cause you won't catch me in pictures tryna show my soles,
CMAR, we come and done the place,
Ice ever melts, man a flood the place,
Red, white, and blue diamonds, me and Wretch are the same,
And yeah, we in the same chamber, but ain't the same chain.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Chip:
You need me, man, I don't,
Make some noise everybody (Give it up for Ed Sheeran),
You need me, man, I don't,
One more time, make some noise for Chip,
Say, you need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, scream it out, scream it out,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you.

Verse 10: Wretch 32, Wretch 32 & Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran:
You need three, man, I don't need two,
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up,
In my own lane like I'm stepping on a double clutch,
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching,
Now I've found out being odd ain't even,
Qualified for everything, long straight season,
Not a dilemma king, got a straight queening,
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in,
MC with the mic, MC dinner time,
I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light,
Didn't even have to do a disco rap,
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque,
This is what happens when your gift is talent,
And all you imagined exists, imagine,
I never drop shit, but I came from the back end,
Now I've got the game in my palm, I'ma smash it.

Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Wretch 32:
You need me, man, I don't,
Make some noise for Wretch 32 (Ed Sheeran),
You need me, man, sing it out (Ah yeah),
You need me, man, scream it,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, now everybody go.

Interlude:
Oh, oh, oh,
Go oh, oh, oh,
Go oh,
Go oh,
Go woo,
Go woo-ah.

Right, so this is the point in the gig where we change a little bit,
One more time, make some noise for my beautiful guests,
Devlin, Sway, Chip, Wretch 32,
This is where we change it, right,
At the beginning, you were the gospel choir,
Now you're in competition with each other,
You are split down the middle,
This side, all along the back into the middle, up top, you are one side,
This side, all along the front into the middle, up top, you are one side,
To make this a little more interesting, we're gonna use some roleplay,
There's a film called West Side Story,
In West Side Story, you have two rival gangs,
Jets and Sharks, and they don't get on,
And they come to a final battle with guns, knives, and bats,
They're running towards each other, running, running, ah,
Stop, sing,
This is how it's gonna work, each side, you are one gang each,
We're gonna use volume, not violence,

Scream it out as loud as you can, Jets first, then Sharks.

Verse 11:
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic,
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it,
Replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Into another rapper shoes, using new laces,
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack, aiming for the papers,
Selling CDs from my rucksack, aiming for the majors,
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, I still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache,
I hit back, when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Primark tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though,
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos,
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio,
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio,
Melody music maker, reading all the papers,
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator.

Chorus:
'Cause you need me, man, scream it out,
You need me, man, I don't, sing it out,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, scream it,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, take it up one more and go,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you,
You need me, man, I don't need you at all,

This love is a blaze I saw flames from the side of the,
Stage,
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days,
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know but,
Something to drink and maybe something to smoke,
Let it go until I roll with the chain,
Singing we found love in a local rave,
No I don't really know what I'm supposed to say but I can,
Just figure it out and hope and pray,
I told her my name and said it's nice to meet ya then she,
Handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila,
I already know it she's a keeper,
Just from this once small act of kindness I'm in,
Deep if anybody finds out I am meant to drive home but i,
Took all of it now I'm not sobering up,
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now she's,
Kissing my mouth.

    1 ContributorThe city -,
These are the song lyrics for song #858:
 - raps LyricsLook its funny how the city where the Queen sleeps,
Still ain’t got clean streets,
But there ain’t a day when she ain’t got clean sheets,
Homeless people roam with needles and,
You’ve got to pay tax to afford a vehicle,
Tube fare doubles up every two years,
And the buses upstairs are a no go area,
Man are like ‘Pass me your mobile, here me now’,
And with the crunch of the credit,
You can’t get a roof over your head,
You’re stuck in the debit,
But every single month they come for the debit,
Direct action, if you don’t play they,
Dive and snatch things and it don’t say that,
Now equipped fear ‘cause a victim of inflation,
The black letters turned red and they been patient,
And now six years rent has just been wasted.

.

I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease,
Pollution in the air matches that on the street,
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like,
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like,
I was a country boy when I moved out,
Grew up too fast for my family to find out,
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives,
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies,
This city won’t erase me,
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me,
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but,
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from,
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now,
Knees weak, but we never slow down,
Now I start to do my music properly,
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me,
You might also like.

Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses,
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers,
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment,
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff,
The church pastor's still praying for answers,
Way too much congestion, they're charging,
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing,
But there ain't no funny side,
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time,
Stone Island jacket, keep warm,
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned,
And also mind the gap and keep calm,
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard,
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird,
So as much as I'm in love with this city,
Just maybe I've had enough of the city,

Breathing in the snowflakes,
Burnt lungs, sour taste,
Light's gone, day's end,
Struggling to pay rent,
Long nights, strange men.

Pre-Chorus:

She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since 18,
But lately, her face seems,
Slowly sinking, wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
The worst things in life come free to us.

Chorus 1:
Cause she's just under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple of grams,

Verse 1:
Stop the clocks, it's amazing,
You should see the way the light dances off your hair,
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red,
Saturday morning is fading,
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand,
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again.

Pre-Chorus:
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle,
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow,
So alone in love like the world had disappeared,
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go,
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow,
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears.

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,

But I can't wait to go home.

Driving at 90 down those country lanes,

 - + ghetts LyricsI'm in so deep Omar Eds can relate to my situation its so real,
Pain ain't the emotion I wanna feel but I'm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic,
I'll be on a hill, keeping my head above water,
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner,
So I move with the force of a sorcerer,
It's dark when I'm about just me myself and my shadow,
Im paro, running out of ammo, and it seems everybody around me is on the same path so it's narrow,
Then less than a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella,
I play fool to catch wise how we ever gonna get so clever,
How can I be at my best with this pressure,
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind's infected with terror,
No wonder I'm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds,
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests,
Oh-o-oh,
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence,
It seems the way you look back, should of, would of could of but I bet you can't bring shit with a good back,
Back to fifteen our face to myself, then I'm more than a hood track.

But I am a ship that's so many years, but I'm maintaining,
Plain sailing, no commotion,
Like a dolphin, when it's in motion,
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken,
No real shit, throw my skin ain't close to corrosion,
Fuck em all, this ain't no tug a war, still don't get roped in the open, I don't wanna reveal my violent side,
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign,
Then I'ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye,
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don't wanna see this guy survive.

 Song title is   Eyes Closed (Piano Version) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I know it's a bad idea,
But how can I help myself?,
Been inside for most this year,
And I thought a few drinks, they might help,
It's been a while, my dear,
Dealin' with the cards life dealt,
I'm still holdin' back these tears,
While my friends are somewhere else.

Pre-Chorus:
I pictured this year a little bit different, wedded in February,
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?,
Every song reminds me you're gonе and I feel the lump form in my throat,
'Cause I'm herе alone.

Chorus:
Just dancin' with my eyes closed,
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you,
And time is movin' so slow,
And I don't know what else that I can do,
So I'll keep dancin' with my.

But I lost more than my friend,
I can't help at missin' you.

Pre-Chorus:
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready,
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?,
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone,
And life just goes on.

 - + Random Impulse + Sway + Wretch 32 LyricsThey tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep,
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see,
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease,
To the retrieve then I can't let them be,
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17,
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?,
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's never been,
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen,
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it,
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing,
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading.

Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me,
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me,
Oh, oh, oh!,
I feel my nightmares watching me.

You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze,
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em,
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her,
Now I'm taking control of my inception,
Cause they try to hit misses with my direction,
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night,
The haters know where the family lives,
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger,
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it,
They say sleep is the cause of death,
But I hear shit because I am deaf,
Gang signs I'm N/A reading,

And daydream about losing my sanity,
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow,
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed,
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep,
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat,
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep,
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia,
Now, I Mr hard worker,

 -o-Lution Dub) LyricsI wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And every excuse I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all,
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me,
So now I'll maybe leave back there,
I'm sat here wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold I'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat it,
'Cause you take part of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.

Should I, should I?,
Maybe I'll get drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
To feel a little love.

I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I've got no plans for the weekend,
So shall we speak then,
Keep it between friends,
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to,

Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before,
You don't hold me anymore.

I know I can't heal things with a hand shake,
You know I can't change as I began saying,
You cut me wide open like landscape,
Open bottles of beer but never champagne,
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make.

Should I, should I?,
Maybe I'll get drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
To feel a little love.

All by myself,
I'm here again,
All by myself,
You know I'll never change,
All by myself,

I'm just drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,

Slip, trip, fell in love like you cast a spell,
Wonder if you're a witch or you'd know you're the only one I think of,
When the drink starts flowing, well we know what's involved and we disengage,
Well if this is fate then we shouldn't drift apart,
Or let it slip away 'til death do us part,
Through sickness and in health,
I cannot go a day without picturing your face (Not one),
And the way you kiss me lips,
I flutter like the first time (Woah),
I'll always come back to you,
You're the only one I've chased,
But I've made mistakes that could jеopardise everything,
I'm tеrrified to lose you.

 Song title is   Drunk (Doctor P Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all,
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me,
So now I'll maybe lean back there,
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.

Hook:
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk,
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk.

Breakdown:
Drunk, drunk, drunk,
Drunk, drunk, drunk,
Drunk, drunk, drunk,
Drunk, drunk, drunk.

Verse 2:
I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
Now I'll watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can,
And I've got no plans for the weekend,
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?,
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to,
There may be other people like us,
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up,
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before,
You don't hold me anymore,
You might also likeHook:
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk,
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk.

Breakdown:
Drunk, drunk, drunk,
Drunk, drunk, drunk,
Drunk, drunk, drunk,
Drunk, drunk, drunk.

Verse 3:
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name,
I know I can't heal things with a handshake,
You know I can't change, as I began saying,
You cut me wide open like a landscape,
Open bottles of beer but never champagne,
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make,
Should I? Should I?.

Bridge:
Maybe I'll get drunk, again,
I'll be drunk, again,
Maybe I'll get drunk, again,
I'll be drunk, again,
 

 Song title is   Bad Habits (Remix) (Live at the BRIT Awards 2022) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
(One, two, three, four),
Ooh, ooh.

Verse 1:
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no,
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control,
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes,
And tonight had something wonderful.

Chorus:
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone,
Conversations with a stranger I barely know,
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't,
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do,
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space,
And I know I lose control of the things that I say,
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape,
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true,
My bad habits lead to you.

Post-Chorus:
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
My bad habits lead to you,
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
My bad habits lead to you,

Every pure intention ends when the good times start,
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark,
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark,
I only know how to go too far.

 Song title is   Drunk (Lazy Jay’s Wasted in London Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
These are the song lyrics for song #888:
 -up, lip sticks to me,
So now I maybe lean back there,
I'm sat here wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.

But a house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold I'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat in,
'Cause you take parts of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.

Should I, should I?,
Maybe I'll get drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
I'll be drunk again,
To feel a little love.

I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I got no plans for the weekend,
So should we speak then,
Keep it between friends,

 Song title is   Take Me to Church (BBC Live Lounge) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
My lover's got humor,
She's the giggle at a funeral,
Knows everybody's disapproval,
I should've worshipped her sooner,
If the heavens ever did speak,
She's the last true mouthpiece,
Every Sunday's getting more bleak,
A fresh poison each week,
We were born sick,
You heard them say it,
My church offers no absolutes,
She tells me Worship in the bedroom,
The only Heaven I'll be sent to,
Is when I'm alone with you,
I was born sick, but I love it,
Command me to be well.

Pre-Chorus:
Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen.

Chorus:
Take me to church,
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies,
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me that deathless death,
Good God, let me give you my life,
Take me to church,
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies,
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me that deathless death,
Good God, let me give you my life,
You might also likeVerse 2:
If I'm a pagan of the good times,
My lover's the sunlight,
To keep the goddess on my side,
She demands a sacrifice,
Drain the whole sea,
Get something shiny,
Something meaty for the main course,
That's a fine looking high horse,
What you got in the stable?,
We've a lot of starving faithful,
That looks tasty,
That looks plenty,
This is hungry work.

Chorus:
Take me to church,
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies,
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me my deathless death,
Good God, let me give you my life,
Take me to church,
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies,
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me my deathless death,
Good God, let me give you my life,
Bridge:
No masters or kings when the ritual begins,
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin,
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene,
Only then I am human,
Only then I am clean.

Pre-Chorus:
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen.

Chorus:
Take me to church,
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies,
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me that deathless death,

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies,

 Song title is   Bring Me Back by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I think I took too much,
Credit card and rolled up dollar bill,
On a hotel table,
I don't know where they went,
I've lost all of my pride,
Washed down with another pill,
But I've been so complacent,
I don't know where them days went.

Chorus 1:
Well I broke my own heart tonight, mama,
Now I'm coughing up blood in the sink,
And if I take my life don't cry for me, mama,
I've spent a while on the brink,
I've never felt so cold,
I can't feel my heart beating,
My lord, bring me back to life,
I know I lost my soul,
Where's my God when I need him,
My lord, bring me back to life.

Verse 2:
Roll one and light it up,
These purple clouds could set the alarm off,
Police come and take me,
Maybe that would save me,
You know I've had my share of drinking, drugs, and women who,
Who love you 'cause you're famous,
But I guess that I can't blame them,

Well I broke my own heart tonight, mama,
Now I'm coughing up blood in the sink,
And if I take my life don't cry for me, mama,

Can you see my eyes fading?,
My lord, bring me back to life,
White powder in my nose,
Where's my God when I need him? (Help),
My Lord, bring me back to life.

?:
For every time that I've been high,
And when I made my mom cry,
Oh Lord, bring me back to life,
For all the women that have been my love,
Heartbroken in an instant,
My Lord, bring me back to life,
For all the friends that I don't see,
And the people could think they know me,
My Lord, bring me back to life,
For all the drugs that I've taken,
Sitting in a strangers basement,
My Lord, bring me back to life,
For all the memories I don't want,
'Cause I got nothing to show for,
Oh Lord, bring me back to life,
And I don't want any of this,
And I don't want any of this,
I don't want,
Oh Lord, bring me back to lif,

 Song title is   Overpass Graffiti (TCTS Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
This is a dark parade,
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on,
I know your friends may say,
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love,
Photographs in sepia tones,
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold alone,
There are times when I can feel your ghost,
Just when I'm almost letting you go,
The cards were stacked against us both.

Chorus:
I will always love you for what it's worth,
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass,
And I know time may change the way you think of us,
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop,
Love that will never leave,
Baby, you will never be lost on me.

Verse 2:
This is a goddamn shame,
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted,
Know I should walk away,
But I just can't replace us or even erase us,
The car was stuck, the engine stalled,
And both of us got caught out in the snow alone,
There were times when I forget the lows,
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known,
The cards were stacked against us both,

Verse 1::
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer,
Sun down and they all come out,
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers,
The party's on, so they're heading downtown,
('Round here).

Everybody's looking for a come-up,
And they wanna know what you're about,
Me in the middle with the one I love and,
We're just tryna figure everything out.

Verse 1:
This is a dark parade,
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on,
I know your friends may say,
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love,
Photographs in sepia tones,
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold alone,
There are times when I can feel your ghost,
Just when I'm almost letting you go,
The cards were stacked against us both.

Chorus:
I will always love you for what it's worth,
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass,
And I know time may change the way you think of us,
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop,
Love that will never leave,
Baby, you will never be lost on me.

Verse 2:
This is a goddamn shame,
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted,
Know I should walk away,
But I just can't replace us or even erase us,
The car was stuck, the engine stalled,
And both of us got caught out in the snow alone,
There were times when I forget the lows,
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known,
The cards were stacked against us both,

She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since eighteen,
But lately her face seems,
Slowly sinking, wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
The worst things in life come free to us,
Cause we're just under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple grams,
And she don't want to go outside tonight,
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
And sells love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
Angels to fly,
Ripped gloves, rain coat,
Tried to swim and stay afloat,
Dry house, wet clothes,
Loose change, bank notes,

 Song title is   Eyes Closed (Lost Frequencies Remix) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
I know it's a bad idea,
But how can I help myself?,
Been inside for most this year,
And I thought a few drinks, they might help,
It's been a while, my dear,
Dealin' with the cards life dealt,
I'm still holdin' back these tears,
While my friends are somewhere else.

Pre-Chorus:
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February,
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?,
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel the lump form in my throat,
'Cause I'm here alone.

Chorus:
Just dancin' with my eyes closed,
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you,
And time is movin' so slow,
And I don't know what else that I can do,
So I'll keep dancin' with my.

Post-Chorus:
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
So I'll keep dancin' with my,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
So I'll keep dancin' with my,

Delusion is here again,
And I think you'll come home soon,
A word brings me right back in,
Then it's only me that's in this room,
I guess I could just pretend,
The colours are more than blue,
But I lost more than my friend,
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah).

Pre-Chorus:
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready,
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?,
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone,
And life just goes on.

Chorus:
So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed,
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you,
And time is movin' so slow,
And I don't know what else that I can do,
So I'll keep dancin' with my.

 Song title is   Guiding light - cover by Ed Sheeran:
    1 ContributorGuiding light -,
Verse 1:
Well the road is wide,
Waters run on either side,
And my shadow in the fading light,
Is stretching out towards the night,
When the sun is low,
And I have so much more to go,
And my lonely heart is beating so,
Tired of the wonder,
There's a sign ahead,
Though I think it's the same one again,
So I'm thinking 'bout my only friend,
Till I find my way home.

Chorus:
Cause when I need to get home,
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light,
When I need to get home,
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light.

Verse 2:
Oh, well the air is cold,
And yonder lies my sleeping soul,
By the branches broke like bones,
This weeping tree no longer holds,
Oh well, the night is still,
And I have not yet lost my will,
Oh, and I will keep on moving 'till,
Until I find my way home,

 Song title is   Salt Water (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
Thank you very much, how you guys doing?,
Welcome to Subtract,
So um, the origins of this album,
I know I've written about it on, online but like,
When I finished Plus, my debut album, the next album I was gonna make was Subtract,
And I went in, uh, with Rick Rubin,
And we started recording this acoustic album,
And it just sort of morphed into Multiply,
Because I don't think I was probably ready to make an acoustic album,
I wanted to, you know, make, sing with Pharrell and Thinking Out Loud and Photograph and do, and do all this sort of stuff and then,
After that came Divide and,
After Divide I really wanted to make Subtract,
But it also morphed into Equals in the pandemic,
And I wanted to come out of the pandemic with Bad Habits and havе a song that's made people dancе and stuff,
So I'd been putting this record together over a decade with all my favorite acoustic songs that I'd written over the last decade,
And it was uh, slated to be put out this year,
Uh, and then at the beginning of last year I had, I probably had the darkest month of my life,
And it made me address lots of things and,
I'd met Aaron previously,
Everyone make some noise for mister Aaron Dessner, right over there,
And I'd met Aaron through Taylor,
Taylor had hooked me and Aaron up through email,
And then me and Aaron went to dinner,
This is like November 2021,
Me and Aaron went for dinner and uh,
I was telling him I'm just about to put out this album Subtract,
But after that I would love to try something different maybe with electric guitars, blah, blah, blah,
And he sent me a bunch of instrumentals,
And I sort of had them for awhile,
And I was like, I will, I'll get to them eventually but you know,
I'm gonna put out Subtract and do all of that,
And then February happened,
And I basically wrote over all these instrumentals,
We got in the studio and we, and we finished it,
And uh, what has come out of it is actually what Subtract was always meant to be which is, which is this record,
Uh, so I'm gonna play it in full, all the songs and explain stories behind them,
This song is called Salt Water,
It's basically like, I've had, you know, ups and downs throughout my life since I was very very young,
And uh, you know, as I've got older and become a parent,
Those ups and downs, you feel more ashamed about because, you know you,
You hate thinking dark dark thoughts when you have children to look after,
But this is uh, a song which basically encapsulates all of that what if,
And it's called Salt Water,
You might also likeVerse 1:
There's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes,
When the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole,
Well, the blades are two feet tall,
I wade in green, I'm movin' forward, to where? God only knows,
Feel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face,
Saying, It's alright to run from all this pain,
Oh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs,
I'll scream, It's all for love,
I'll scream, It's all for love.

Chorus:
Come and kiss me, salt water,
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees,
I'm free in salt water,
Embrace the deep and leave everything,
It was just a dream.

Verse 2:
I can feel it up ahead where the sky meets the ground,
And after that, there's only moving grey,
I'm filled up with regret,
With things I did or never said, just leave that well alone.

Chorus:
Come and kiss me, salt water,
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees,
I'm free in salt water,
Embrace the deep and leave everything,
It was just a dream,
Post-Chorus:
It was just a dream,
Is it just a dream?,
It was just a dream,
It was just a dream,
Was it just a dream?.

Bridge:
Now I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell,
Or is it something else? I just can't tell,
And when there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step,
And say, Well, here it goes,
I say, Well, here it goes.

Chorus:
Come and kiss me, salt water,
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees,
I'm free in salt water,
Embrace the deep and leave everything,
It was just a drea,
 

 Song title is   Boat (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
Verse 1:
Came in for the embers,
Stayed out for the breeze,
I need to feel elements to remind me,
There's beauty when it's bleak.

Pre-Chorus:
Stuck out long before lights down,
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know.

Chorus:
The more that I love, the less that I feel,
The times that I jumped never were real,
They say that all scars will heal, but I know,
Maybe I won't,
But the waves won't break my boat,
But the waves won't brеak my boat.

Verse 2:
The stones crash on the boardwalk,
Thе wind rush through the trees,
I keep my eyes peeled,
The memories always fall short,
Of what we could've been.

What do I need? Oh, I know,

Pre-Chorus:
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February,
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?,
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel the lump form in my throat,
'Cause I'm here alone.

Chorus:
Just dancin' with my eyes closed,

And time is movin' so slow,
And I don't know what else that I can do,
So I'll keep dancin' with my.

Delusion is here again,
And I think you'll come home soon,
A word brings me right back in,

But I lost more than my friend,
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah),

 Song title is   No Strings (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
So my dad, uh, said to me when I got married,
He said, um,
You will not know what real love and marriage is,
Until there's death and there's, uh, real sickness,
And he said this because, uh, that happens when he first married my mum,
There was a real, real grief that happened in the family,
And real, real sickness that also then ended up in grief,
That they both had to go through,
And he said that that really brought them together,
And hе just said that once that happens it's an unbreakablе bond,
And you can't, you can't ever break it,
And um, ya know, I've been married now almost five years,
And uh, he, ya know, I've always felt real, real closeness,
But last year was when that sort of unbreakable bond was made,
And I know, I know you should feel that before with, ya know, marriage and then children and then, and blah, blah, blah,
But I really feel like,
We got through 2022, we can get through anything, basically,
And I wanna say, like, we're, we're nearing, we're nearing the end of Subtract now, too,
There's two more songs, thank you for sitting through this,
Little procession,
This is my favorite song on the album,
Might be one of my favorite songs I've, I've ever written,
Uh, and it's called No Strings.

Verse 1:
If we make it through this year,
Then nothin' can break us,
Trouble leaves, then reappears,
But we've shown we can take it,

Chorus:
But this is no strings, you are who I love,
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart,

It's just growin' pains.

Verse 2:
If we make it through this year,
We should celebrate it,
Rarified atmosphere,
Till now, we evaded.

We tore the walls down to build them up,
Never was in doubt.

Chorus:
But this is no strings, you are who I love,
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart,
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love,
It's just growin' pains,
Bridge:
We did not fight for love,
Just to let it be defeated,
What we're goin' through is common,
But, it doesn't mean we don't feel it,
It would be easy just to give it up,
I know we've got enough reason,
But every time that we have come undone.

Chorus:
I'll say, It's no strings, you are who I love,
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart,
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love,

My bad habits lead to latе nights endin' alone,
Conversations with a stranger I barely know,
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't,
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do,
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space,

Intro:
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah).

Verse 1:
I met this girl late last year,
She said, Don't you worry, if I disappear,
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake,
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait,
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned,
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn,
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right,
I went away for months until our paths crossed again,
She told me, I was never looking for a friend,
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin,
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM,
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing,
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah).

Chorus:
Don't (hhh) with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah),
Don't (hhh) with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that babe,
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah),

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her,
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza,
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her,
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her,
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature,
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either,
But, me and her, we make money the same way,
Four cities, two planes, the same day,
And those shows have never been what it's about,
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out,
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch,
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now,
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out,
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about,
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing,
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah).

Chorus:
Don't (hhh) with my love,
That heart is so cold,

I don't wanna know that babe,
Verse 3:
(Knock, knock, knock) On my hotel door,
I don't even know if she knows what for,
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya,
Trust and respect is what we do this for,
I never intended to be next,
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all,
And I never saw him as a threat,
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah),
It's not like we were both on tour,
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor,
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah),
This is not the way you realized what you wanted,
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest,
And all this time, God knows I'm singing,
(Ah-lah-m-lah-lah).

Chorus:
Don't (hhh) with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that babe (Ah-lah-m-lah-lah),
Don't (hhh) with my love,
I told her she knows,
Take aim and reload,

 Song title is   Perfect (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
Gotta be honest, I'm super nervous about tonight,
Um, I never played, uh, a whole album in full with the band the way it sounds, exactly like it sounds on the record,
I'm usually, this is my live set, I'm on a loop pedal and it always sounds quite different to the record,
And that's kind of the way that I like it,
I like, you listening to the album and coming to a gig and then just hearing it re-imagined,
But because you've never heard this album I'm about to play, we can kind of give it to you exactly the way that it is on the rеcord,
And you can, I'ma tell you stories from it and blah-blah-blah,
But it's a, yeah, it's gonna bе, it's gonna be weird,
'Cause these stories are all real stories that happened in my life,
And, uh, I often find when you release music, the music then belongs to the public,
So the next song I'm gonna play, it's been out for a while,
I wrote it about my wife, but it now belongs to all of you,
And you guys hear this song, you don't think, Ah, Ed's wife,
You think about the person, uh, that, that you love,
But the thing is with the songs I'm about to play you is,
They don't belong to you yet, they're gonna start belonging to you tonight,
And, uh, well, I mean, one of them, Eyes Closed has been out for a couple of days,
And it's been nice, sort of, hearing the stories of that,
But anyway, this is a song that I wrote back in 2015 that used to belong to me,
And now belongs to all of you.

Verse 1:
I found a love for me,
Darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead,
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet,

Your heart is all I own,
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine.

Chorus:
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favourite song,
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath,
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight.

Verse 2:
But I found a woman stronger than anyone I know,
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home,
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets,
To carry love, to carry children of our own.

Pre-Chorus:
We are still kids, but we're so in love,
Fightin' against all odds,
I know we'll be alright this time,
Darlin', just hold my hand,
Be my girl, I'll be your man,
I see my future in your eyes,
Chorus:
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favourite song,
I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful,
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight.

Bridge:
Mm, mm, mm.

Chorus:
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favourite song,
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met,
An angel in person, she looks perfect,
No, I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight,

 Song title is   Sycamore (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
So, that day we got the news, uh,
I got sent all these, all these songs, uh,
And we were driving up to a specialist,
Um, in North London to sort of get results and scans and work out what the next, next steps were,
And I wrote this song, basically,
I just find, like, we're born into life with love,
Like, we're, we're, our parents love us and we're born in love,
And hopefully we leave the same way,
But yеah, this is called Sycamore.

Verse 1:
Sycamore in thе summer bearing leaves,
Swing, you're pushin' our daughter underneath,
Flowers bloom in the garden, sway in breeze,
Just imagine a world where we could be.

Now, in the waiting room, emotions runnin' wild,
Worried 'bout my lover and I'm worried 'bout our child,
Part of me was always in denial, it's gonna take a little while.

In our story, love in, love out,
We are glorious,
In our story, love in, love out,
We are glorious,

What's he gonna say after I think you better sit?,
Brace yourself, something's about to hit,

We are glorious,

 Song title is   Vega (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
So it was pouring with rain when Aaron sent me all these, um, songs,
And the first lines of this song is Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass / But, God, I love the sound of heaven,
And um, yeah, this is a song, another song that was written in that batch, along with Borderline,
And along with the next two, well, the next one, at least,
And uh, it's called Vega,
The Vega is, um, the brightest star in the Lyra constellation,
Which, uh, that I find quite cool,
I kind of like, it's, I found it really weird writing to Aaron's music 'cause,
What, what happens with, Aaron basically sends a fully formed song, еssentially, and you write over it,
And usually I would bе in the studio and I would get, I would pick up a guitar and I'd go, Right, what do we write about tonight? We do 'bad habits lead to late nights' okay, is that a good line, is it 'bad habits lead to late nights' is this-,
And you kind of go back and forth and you bounce ideas, and that's the collaborative process that I've usually done,
Whereas this collaborative process is Aaron going like, Just write what you feel,
And I found words pouring out and some of them I was like, What does that even mean? 'It burns like hell to be Vega',
Like what, but it was just a line that just came out of my mouth whilst writing this song,
And, ya know, this song probably took as much time to write as the song itself, like it just fell out,
Uh, and I can't describe it,
Aaron's, Aaron's music has songs in it that you just have to,
You know, you know like in Harry Potter when it's the pensive and say the bit out,
I find that like, Aaron's song is Dumbledore's mind, basically,
And you just, take out, but yeah,
So, this is Vega.

Verse 1:
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass,
But, God, I love the sound of heaven,
Sat cross-legged on the carpet,
Listenin' to vinyl, trying to ignore the weather,
You might also likePre-Chorus:
This week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight,
What can you do, but pray?,
And count your blessings, it wasn't any other way,
Don't leave it up to fate.

Chorus:
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part,
Light up the night, we were made to be stars,
But it burns like hell to be Vega.

Verse 2:
Clouds keep forming over this house,
Blocking out the sun, I'm trying to keep it all together,
One door closes then one opens, gotta keep the focus,
If we believe, then she'll get better.

Pre-Chorus:
The days are long, but they pass within an instant, babe,
It is the strangest thing,
I'll count my blessings the day I see you smile again,
This war, we've got to win.

Chorus:
Keep it inside, don't let no one see your heart,
No one can judge, we're the same in the dark,
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part,
Light up the night, we were made to be stars,
But it burns like hell to be Vega,
Bridge:
Same problems, different options,
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this,
Need respite, bleed time dry,
She'll be fine, she'll be fine,
Same problems, different options,
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this,
Need respite, bleed time dry,
She'll be fine, she'll be fine.

Outro:
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, worrying to death,
But I guess this is human nature,
We are made to shine like stars, but,
That don't mean it don't burn like hell to be Vega,
 

 Song title is   Spark (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
    Right, um, so this next song is called Spark,
Intro:
Right, um, so this next song is called Spark,
And uh, it's basically about, I feel like, I feel like life's in chapters,
And um, getting, I don't know, feeling reminiscent can sometimes be a bad thing,
Because you keep yourself in the last chapter,
And I feel like it's all about, um,
I don't know, you know, in like movies when people have those breakups and they put everything into the fire and they go, And it's a new dawn and blah, blah, blah,
I feel like that's a healthy thing sometimes to just move on and just be like That was that, and this is now,
And uh, the lyrics of this chorus, uh, you know, We'll build a fire and we'll torch our old life and hope the original spark of what made it amazing survives and we'll just move on from it,
But uh, yeah, this is Spark.

Verse 1:
We've been lost for a long time,
In a rut, no escape signs,
And, for love, we were so blind,
Oh, I hate to see you cry,
There've been times where the truth lied,
Now, it's clear as a blue sky.

Pre-Chorus:
Like a Band-Aid over deeper cuts, we tried,
We couldn't stop the fate descending on the night.

Chorus:
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives,
And hope the spark survives,
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky,
Let the memories take flight,
And hope the spark survives,

Verse 2:
Oh, I wonder, will we pull through?,
All we ever do is argue,
With not a lot, but we make do,
How I wish you wouldn't say that,
There are things you can't take back,
When you leave, I always face facts.

Pre-Chorus:
Like a hand that's trying to hold the water back,
We couldn't stop the ocean leaking in the cracks.

Chorus:
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives,
And hope the spark survives,
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky,
Let the memories take flight,
And hope the spark survives.

Post-Chorus:
Yeah, we hope the spark survives.

Bridge:
We've taken roads,
That led to confusion,
But right now, it don't matter at all (Na-na),
We'll bring it back,
Our love's no illusion,
The higher we go, the harder we fall, and now,
Chorus:
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives,
And hope the spark survives,
Use words as kindling, light up the night sky,
Let the memories take flight,

 Song title is   Shivers (Apple Music Live) by Ed Sheeran:
Intro:
So, it's quite fun being a, uh, an opening act,
I just wanna introduce myself,
I'm a, I'm an up-and-coming singer-songwriter from Suffolk,
And I'll have CDs at the merch stand afterwards,
You know the last time I played this room was in 2012,
For uh, for Plus and, uh,
Basically I had The A Team out and that was, that was the song that people came for,
And I always dreamed of playing this room and have people like this,
I remember coming to watch Bon Iver here and everyone was like completely sat and silent and listening,
And I was saying earlier, likе,
I've been a singer-songwriter for a long timе, but, ya know,
I really enjoy making pop music and I really enjoy that side of things,
But this is the first time I've felt like I actually am allowed to be a singer-songwriter,
I'm sort of thirty-two, I've, I've lived a bit,
And I'm playing an album tonight that I feel is, uh, emotional,
And I, I think you're gonna like it,
And this pop point of the show is about fun,
So, it's not about, uh, introspective thoughts and sadness,
It is about Shivers.

Verse 1:
Yeah-yeah,
I took an arrow to the heart,
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours,
Strawberries and then somethin' more,
Ooh, yeah, I want it all,
Lipstick on my guitar, ooh,
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far,
Go dancin' underneath the stars,
Oh, yeah, I want it all,
Mmm, you got me feelin' like,

Chorus:
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that,
And when you're close up, give me the shivers,
Baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks,
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back,
Say, Ooh, I love it when you do it like that,
And when you're close up, give me the shivers,
Baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks,
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back.

Verse 2:
Into the car,
On the backseat in the moonlit dark,
Wrap me up between your legs and arms,
Oh, I can't get enough,
You know you could tear me apart, ooh,
Put me back together and take my heart,
I never thought that I could love this hard,
Oh, I can't get enough,
Mmm, you got me feelin' like,
Pre-Chorus:
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes,
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm,

With the fire you got, this thing we started,
I don't want it to stop,
You know you make me shiver,
Yeah, you got me singin' like,

Song title is : All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) From the Vault:  by Taylor Swift:
[Verse 1:
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now.

Verse 2:
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze,
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate,
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

Pre-Chorus:
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh.

Chorus:
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street,
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me,
Wind in my hair, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

Verse 3:
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red,
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me,
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy,
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town,
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, Any time now,
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was,
'Til we were dead and gone and buried,
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same,
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,

And I know it's long gone and,
There was nothing else I could do,
And I forget about you long enough,
To forget why I needed to.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,
Down the stairs, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And there we are again when nobody had to know,
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath,
Sacred prayer and we'd swear,
To remember it all too well, yeah.

Bridge:
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up,
Runnin' scared, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest,
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here,
'Cause I remember it all, all, all,
Verse 4:
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell,
Every time you double-cross my mind,
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine,
And that made me want to die,
The idea you had of me, who was she?,
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you,
Not weepin' in a party bathroom,
Some actress askin' me what happened, you,
That's what happened, you,
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes,
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show,
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come,
And he said, It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one.

Verse 5:
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it,
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it,
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,
You can't get rid of it,
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, you were there,
You remember it all,
Down the stairs, you were there,
You remember it all,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Verse 6:
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes,
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age,
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones,
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight,
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?,
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?,
'Cause in this city's barren cold,
I still remember the first fall of snow,
And how it glistened as it fell,
I remember it all too well.

Outro:
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?,
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?,
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there),
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh),
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there),
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it (All too well),
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it.

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you,
Not weeping in a party bathroom,
Some actress asking me what happened, you,
That's what happened, you,
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes,
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show,
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come,
And he said, It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one.

Verse 5:
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it,
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it,
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,
You can't get rid of it,
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, you were there,
You remember it all,
Down the stairs, you were there,
You remember it all,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Verse 6:
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes,
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age,
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones,
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight,
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?,
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?,
'Cause in this city's barren cold,
I still remember the first fall of snow,
And how it glistened as it fell,
I remember it all too well.

Outro:
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?,
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?,
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it all too well.

Spoken Outro:
I love you guys so much.

СрпскиРусскийRomânăPortuguêsEnglishItalianoBahasa IndonesiaMagyarDeutschFrançaisHrvatskiChinese TraditionalΕλληνικάУкраїнськаcardigan LyricsVerse 1:
Vintage tee, brand new phone,
High heels on cobblestones,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing,
Sequin smile, black lipstick,
Sensual politics,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing.

Chorus:
But I knew you,
Dancin' in your Levi's,
Drunk under a streetlight, I,
I knew you,
Hand under my sweatshirt,
Baby, kiss it better, I.

Refrain:
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorite.

To kiss in cars and downtown bars,
Was all we needed,
You drew stars around my scars,
But now I'm bleedin'.

Chorus:
'Cause I knew you,
Steppin' on the last train,
Marked me like a bloodstain, I,
I knew you,
Tried to change the ending,
Peter losing Wendy, I,
I knew you,
Leavin' like a father,
Running like water, I,
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing,
Verse 3:
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss,
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs,
The smell of smoke would hang around this long,
'Cause I knew everything when I was young,
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time,
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line,
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired,
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light,
And I knew you'd come back to me,
You'd come back to me,
And you'd come back to me,
And you'd come back.

Refrain:
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorit.

I hit the Sunday matinée,
You know the greatest films of all time were never made.

About why you switched your homeroom, but,
I think it's 'cause of me,
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard,
When I passed your house,
It's like I couldn't breathe.

Pre-Chorus:
You heard the rumors from Inez,
You can't believe a word she says,
Most times, but this time it was true,

Was what I did to you.

But if I just showed up at your party,
Would you have me? Would you want me?,
Would you tell me to go fuck myself,
Or lead me to the garden?,
In the garden, would you trust me,
If I told you it was just a summer thing?,

But I know I miss you.

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser,
Midnights become my afternoons,
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people,
I've ghosted stand there in the room.

Pre-Chorus:
I should not be left to my own devices,
They come with prices and vices,
I end up in crisis,

I wake up screaming from dreaming,
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving,
'Cause you got tired of my scheming,

Chorus:

At teatime, everybody agrees,

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero.

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money,
She thinks I left them in the will,
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out,
She's laughing up at us from Hell.

Breakdown:
It's me, hi,
I'm the problem, it's me,
It's me, hi,
I'm the problem, it's me,
It's me, hi,
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees,
Chorus:
It's me, hi (Hi),
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me),
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees),
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror,
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero.

Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long,
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song,
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease,
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities,
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny,
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July,
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one,
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it,

And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too,
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe,
All the hell you gave me?,
'Cause I  loved  you,  I swear I  loved you,
'Til my  dying day.

And you're the hero flying around, saving face,
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?,
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed,
Look at how my tears ricochet.

Verse 2:
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean,
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring,
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you,
But what a ghostly scene,
You wear the same jewels that I gave you,
As you bury me.

Русский...Ready for It? LyricsVerse 1:
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him,
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted,
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom,
Holdin' him for ransom, some,
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though,
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so,
I see nothing better, I keep him forever,
Like a vendetta-ta.

Verse 2:
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me,
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry,
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and,
We'll move to an island, and,
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor,

Remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light,

Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes,

Tied me to you.

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind,
For the boys who broke my heart,
Now I send their babies presents,
Gold was the color of the leaves,

Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven,

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies,
And it's cool,

中文СрпскиItalianoMagyarPortuguêsNederlandsУкраїнськаDeutsch日本語SvenskaMaroon LyricsVerse 1:
When the morning came,
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf,
'Cause we lost track of time again,
Laughing with my feet in your lap,
Like you were my closest friend,
How'd we end up  on  the  floor, anyway? you  say,
Your roommate's cheap-ass  screw-top rosé, that's how,
I see you every day now.

Chorus:
And I chose you,
The one I was dancing with,
In New York, no shoes,
Looked up at the sky and it was,
The burgundy on my t-shirt,
When you splashed your wine into me,
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,
So scarlet, it was,
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone,
The rust that grew bеtween telephones,
The lips I used to call home,
So scarlet, it was maroon.

Verse 2:
When the silence came,
We were shaking, blind and hazy,
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?,
Sobbing with your head in your hands,
Ain't that the way shit always ends?,
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway,
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us,
I feel you, no matter what,
The rubies that I gave up,

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze,
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate,
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me,
Wind in my hair, I was there,

Verse 3:
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red,

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it,
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it,
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone,
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,
You can't get rid of it,
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah.

РусскийPortuguêsفارسیItalianoΕλληνικάFrançaisBosanskiУкраїнськаthe last great american dynasty LyricsVerse 1:
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny,
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis,
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money,
And the town said, How  did  a  middle-class divorcée do  it?,
The wedding was  charming, if a little gauche,
There's only so far new money goes,
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House,
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud,
The doctor had told him to settle down,
It must have been her fault his heart gave out.

Chorus:
And they said,
There goes the last great American dynasty,
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been,
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen,
She had a marvelous time ruining everything.

Verse 2:
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever,
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city,
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names,
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet,
And losing on card game bets with Dalí,

Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits,
And then it was bought by me.

Honey, when I'm above the trees,
I see this for what it is,
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given,
Is just shit we're dividin' up,
Showed you all of my hiding spots,
I was dancing when the music stopped,
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention,
I haven't met the new me yet.

Chorus:
There'll be happiness after you,
But there was happiness because of you,
Both of these things can be true,
There is happiness.

Past the curses and cries,
Beyond the terror in the nightfall,
Haunted by the look in my eyes,
That would've loved you for a lifetime,
Leave it all behind,

Begin to look like a smirk?,
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons,
Pointed at my deepest hurt?,

I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven,

When a good man hurts you,
And you know you hurt him too.

Verse 3:
Honey, when I'm above the trees,
I see it for what it is,
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head,

All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness,
You haven't met the new me yet,
And I think she'll give you that,

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here,
Pouring out my heart to a stranger,

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise,
Did you realize out of time?,
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy,
That you saw that night,
But you were on somethin',
It was one drink after another,
Fuckin' politics and gender roles,
And you're not sure and I don't know,
Got swept away in the gray,
I just may like to have a conversation.

Chorus:
Can I ask you a question?,
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room,
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you,
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?,
Then what did you do?,
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh,
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh,

Do you wish you could still touch her?,
It's just a question.

Bridge:
Does it feel like everything's just like,
Second best after that meteor strike?,
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?,
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable,
And right, but tonight,

Song title is : Love Story by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #969:
Verse 1:
We were both young when I first saw you,
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts,
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, Hello,
Little did I know.

Pre-Chorus:
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet,
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, Please, don't go, and I said.

Chorus:
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone,
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run,
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say Yes.

Verse 2:
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew,
So close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh,

I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around,
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town.

Breakdown:

I keep waiting for you but you never come,
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said,
Chorus:

One night, a few moons ago,
I saw flecks of what could've been lights,
But it might just have been you,
Passing by unbeknownst to me,
Life is emotionally abusive,
And time can't stop me quite like you did,
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking,
I'm unglued, thanks to you.

Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey:
And it's like snow at the beach,
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful,
Flying in a dream,

No sound, it's all around.

And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it,
'Til you do, 'til it's true.

I washed my hands of us at the club,
You made a mess of me,
I pictured you with other girls in love,
Then threw up on the street,
Like waiting for a bus that never shows,
You just start walkin' on,
They say that if it's right, you know,
Each bar plays our song,
Nothing has ever felt so wrong.

Chorus:
Oh, my, love is a lie,
Shit my friends say to get me by,
It hits different,
It hits different this time,
Catastrophic blues,
Movin' on was always easy for me to do,
It hits different,
It hits different 'cause it's you.

Post-Chorus:
('Cause it's you).

Verse 2:
I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost,
Rip the band-aid off and skip town likе an asshole outlaw,
Freedom felt like summеr then on the coast,
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings,
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar,

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat,
Cursed the space that I needed,
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense,
Why the wound is still bleedin',
You were the one that I loved,
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough,
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes,
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy,
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief,
In the good in the world, you once believed in me,
And I felt you and I held you for a while,
Bet I could still melt your world,
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl,
Verse 3:
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway,
Is that your key in the door?,
Is it okay? Is it you?,
Or have they come to take me away?,
To take me away.

Gray November,
I've been down since July,
Motion capture,
Put me in a bad light,

Trying to find the one where I went wrong,
Writing letters,
Addressed to the fire.

If you would've blinked, then I would've,

If you tasted poison, you could've,
Spit me out at the first chance,
And if I was some paint, did it splatter,
On a promising grown man?,
And if I was a child, did it matter,
If you got to wash your hands?.

Pre-Chorus:
Ooh, all I used to do was pray,
Would've, could've, should've,
If you'd never looked my way.

Chorus:
I would've stayed on my knees,
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil,
At nineteen,
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven,
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts,
Memories feel like weapons,
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering.

Verse 2:
If you never touched me, I would've,
Gone along with the righteous,
If I never blushed, then they could've,
Never whispered about this,
And if you never saved me from boredom,
I could've gone on as I was,
But, Lord, you made me feel important,

Suddenly this summer, it's clear,

Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?.

Your integrity makes me seem small,
You paint dreamscapes on the wall,
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor,
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences,
Sit with you in the trenches,
Give you my wild, give you a child,
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other,
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother,
Is it enough?,
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west,
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best,
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me,

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm,
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come,
All these people think love's for show,
But I would die for you in secret,
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me,
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?,
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?,
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?.

РусскийFrançaisEspañolBosanskiPortuguêsItalianoDeutschGorgeous LyricsIntro:
Gorgeous.

Verse 1:
You should take it as a compliment,
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,
You should think about the consequence,
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong,
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us,
He's in the club doin' I don't know what,
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much).

Pre-Chorus:
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine,
You've ruined my life by not being mine.

Chorus:
You're so gorgeous,
I can't say anything to your face,
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous),
And I'm so furious,
At you for making me feel this way,
But what can I say?,
You're gorgeous.

Verse 2:
You should take it as a compliment,
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you),
And you should think about the consequence,
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room),
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her,
But if you're single that's honestly worse,
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts),

With your hair falling into place like dominoes,
I see me padding across your wooden floors,
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door.

Rain,
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain,
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name,
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same,
All of me changed like midnight.

Verse 1:
My town was a wasteland,
Full of cages, full of fences,
Pageant queens and big pretenders,
But for some, it was paradise,
My boy was a montage,
A slow-motion, love potion,
Jumping off things in the ocean,
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice,
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain.

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name,
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same,

It came like a postcard,
Picture perfect shiny family,
Holiday peppermint candy,
But for him, it's every day,
So I peered through a window,
A deep portal, time travel,
All the love we unravel,
And the life I gave away,

The ties were black, the lies were white,
In shades of gray in candlelight,
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason.

And his mistress moved in,
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything,
No, there ain't no doubt,
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause.

No, no body, no crime,
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die.

No, no,
I think he did it,
No, no,
He did it.

Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim:
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen,
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene,
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me,
(She was with me, dude),
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy,

They think she did it, but they just can't prove it,
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it,
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it.

Verse 1:
Combat, I'm ready for combat,

'Cause cruelty wins in the movies,
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you.

I never grew up, it's getting so old,
Help me hold on to you.

Who could ever leave me, darling,
But who could stay?.

And I cut off my nose just to spite my face,
Then I hate my reflection for years and years.

The room is on fire, invisible smoke,
And all of my heroes die all alone,

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in,
Everyone looked worse in the light,
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven,
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye.

And so I became the butt of the joke,
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked,
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke.

We were in the backseat,
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar,

Windows flung right open, autumn air,
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours,

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind,
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind,
In the shoes I gave you as a present,
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five,
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight.

Chorus:
Best believe I'm still bejeweled,
When I walk in the room,
I can still make the whole place shimmer,
And when I meet the band,
They ask, Do you have a man?,
I could still say, I don't remember,
Familiarity breeds contempt,
Don't put mе in the basement,

Lame fights over the phone,
Wake up in the mornin' with someone,

In someone's handwriting, not mine,

Holdin' hands, just  killin'  time.

If I wanted to know who you were hanging with,
While I was gone, I would've asked you,
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass,
But I felt it when I passed you,
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me,
But if it's all the same to you,
It's the same to me.

Chorus:

You could call me babe for the weekend,

I'm stayin' at my parents' house,
And the road not taken looks real good now,
And it always leads to you and my hometown.

Verse 2:
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist,
And thе school that used to be ours,
The holidays linger like bad perfume,
You can run, but only so far,
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave,
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me.

Chorus:

Even though we boarded them up,
Chandelier's still flickering here,
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,
It's death by a thousand cuts.

Verse:
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home,
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright,
They say, I don't know,
And what once was ours is no one's now,
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share,
Is this small town,
You said it was a great love, one for the ages,
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?,

Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand,
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans,

Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up,
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough,
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts.

I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own,
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone,
We met a few weeks ago,
Now you try on callin' me baby like tryin' on clothes.

Pre-Chorus:
Salute to me, I'm your American queen,
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat,
And we rule the kingdom inside my room,
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars,
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars,
Never took me quite where you do.

Chorus:
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for,
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh-woah,
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go,

My knuckles were bruised like violets,
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked,
Spineless in my tomb of silence,
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground,
And maybe it was egos swinging,
Maybe it was her,
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur.

Chorus:
All that bloodshed, crimson clover,
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over,
My hand was the one you reached for,
All throughout the Great War,
Always remember,

If wе survived the Great War.

You drew up some good faith treaties,
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone,
You said I have to trust more freely,
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire,
And maybe it's the past that's talking,
Screaming from the crypt,
Telling me to punish you for things you never did,
So I justified it,

That was the night I nearly lost you,
I really thought I'd lost you.

Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair,

In the back of my mind,

The crowds in stands went wild,

But the start of an age.

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,

And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remembered.

Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines,
Wishing for right now,
We are the kings and the queens,
You traded your baseball cap for a crown,
When they gave us our trophies,
And we held them up for our town,
And the cynics were outraged,
Screaming, This is absurd,
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans,
Got to rule the world,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likeChorus:
Long live the walls we crashed through,
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,
I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made,
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid,
Long live all the mountains we moved,
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,
I was screaming, Long live that look on your face,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remembered.

Bridge:
Hold on to spinning around,
Confetti falls to the ground,
May these memories break our fall,
Will you take a moment? Promise me this,
That you'll stand by me forever,
But if, God forbid, fate should step in,
And force us into a goodbye,
If you have children some day,
When they point to the pictures,
Please tell 'em my name,
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild,
Tell 'em how I hope they shine,
Long live the walls we crashed through,
I had the time of my life with you,
Chorus:
Long, long live the walls we crashed through,
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,
And I was screaming, Long live all the magic we made,
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid,
Singing, Long live all the mountains we moved,
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,
And long, long live that look on your face,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remember.

Verse 1:
We were crazy to think,
Crazy to think that this could work,
Remember how I said I'd die for you?,
We were stupid to jump,
In the ocean separating us,
Remember how I’d fly to you?.

Pre-Chorus:
And I can't talk to you when you're like this,
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town,
I'm New York City,
I still do it for you, babe,
They all warned us about times like this,
They say the road gets hard and you get lost,
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith.

Chorus:
But we might just get away with it,
Religion's in your lips,
Even if it's a false god,
We'd still worship,
We might just get away with it,

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this,
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you,
You're the West Village,

It was so nice throwing big parties,
Jump into the pool from the balcony,
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea,
And there are no rules when you show up here,
Bass beat rattling the chandelier,
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year.

Pre-Chorus:
So, why'd you have to rain on my parade?,
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates,

Because you break them, I had to take them away,

It was so nice being friends again,
There I was, giving you a second chance,

The knife cuts both ways,
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break.

Pushed from the precipice,
Clung to the nearest lips,

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift:
They tell you while you're young,
Girls, go out and have your fun,
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it,
Criticize the way you fly,
When you're soaring through the sky,
Shoot you down and then they sigh,
And say, She looks like she's been through it.

Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift:
Lord, what will become of me,
Once I've lost my novelty?.

And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about,
And I wake up in the middle of the night,

How can a person know everythin' at eighteen,
But nothin' at twenty-two?,
And will you still want me,
When I'm nothing new?,

How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?,

I should've asked you how to be,
Asked you to write it down for me,

Watched as you signed your name Marjorie,
All your closets of backlogged dreams,
And how you left them all to me,

Right when I felt the moment stop,
Glass shattered on the white cloth,
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there,
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair,
They expected me to find somewhere,
Some perspective, but I sat and stared.

Chorus:
Right where you left me,
You left me no, you left me no,
You left me no choice but to stay here forever,
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no,
You left me no choice but to stay here forever,

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?,
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it,
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy,
How it was supposed to be,
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?,
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it,
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy,
And you're sitting in front of me.

Bridge:
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want,
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right,
I, I could feel the mascara run,
You told me that you met someone,
Glass shattered on the white cloth,
Everybody moved on.

Pre-Chorus:
Help, I'm still at the restaurant,
Still sitting in a corner I haunt,
Cross-legged in the dim light,
They say, What a sad sight,
I, I stayed there,
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair,
I'm sure that you got a wife out there,
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware,
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm,
Mind my business,
If our love died young,
I can't bear witness,
And it's been so long,
But if you ever think you got it wrong,
Chorus:
I'm right where,
You left me,
You left me no, oh, you left me no,

Song title is : Better Man (Taylor’s Version) From the Vault:  by Taylor Swift:
[Verse 1:
I know I'm probably better off on my own,
Than lovin’ a man who didn't know what he had when he had it,
And I see the permanent damage you did to me,
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic.

Pre-Chorus:
I wish it wasn't 4AM, standin’ in the mirror,
Saying to myself, You know you had to do it,
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run.

Chorus:
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again,
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man,
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand,
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man,
A better man.

Verse 2:
I know I'm probably better off all alone,
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute,
And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word,
Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning.

Pre-Chorus:
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now,
Talking down to me like I'd always be around,
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun,
Oh, you never thought I'd run,

Bridge:
I hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have,

And we both know you can't say that.

Song title is : Enchanted by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1037:
Verse 1:
There I was again tonight,
Forcing laughter, faking smiles,
Same old tired, lonely place,
Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy,
Vanished when I saw your face,
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you.

Verse 2:
Your eyes whispered, Have we met?,
Across the room, your silhouette,
Starts to make its way to me,
The playful conversation starts,
Counter all your quick remarks,
Like passing notes in secrecy,
And it was enchanting to meet you,
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you.

Chorus:
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go,
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home,
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew,
I was enchanted to meet you.

Verse 3:
The lingering question kept me up,
2AM, who do you love?,
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake,
Now, I'm pacing back and forth,
Wishing you were at my door,
I'd open up and you would say,
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you,

This was the very first page,
Not where the storyline ends,
My thoughts will echo your name,
Until I see you again,

Please don't be in love with someone else,
Please don't have somebody waiting on you,
Please don't be in love with someone else (Ooh),
Please don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh).

Met someone at a club and he kissed her,

And all the outfits were terrible,
2003 unbearable,
Did you see the photos?,
No, I didn't, but thanks, though.

Stumbled down pretend alleyways,
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne,
I was taken by the view.

And on my page and on the whole world,

Levitate above all the messes made,
Sit quiet by my side in the shade,
And not the kind that's thrown,
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown,

Song title is : Why She Disappeared Poem:  by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1042:
Poem:  LyricsWhen she fell, she fell apart.,
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated,
as a child with sidewalk chalk,
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away,
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends.

When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink,
forming the words of a thousand voices,
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
Whatever you say, it is not right.,
Whatever you do, it is not enough.,
Your kindness is fake.,
Your pain is manipulative..

When she lay there on the ground,,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge,
and a love that was really something,,
Not just the idea of something..

When she finally rose, she rose slowly,
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies,
Wary of phone calls and promises,,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes.

When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness,
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck,
Bathed in her brokenness,
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor,
she never knew she needed,
Standing broad-shouldered next to her,
was a love that was really something,,
not just the idea of something.,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165When she turned to go home,,
She heard the echoes of new words,
May your heart remain breakable,
But never by the same hand twice,
And even louder:
without your past,,
you could never have arrived-,
so wondrously and brutally,,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance,
...here..

And in the death of her reputation,,
She felt truly alive..

Long were the nights when,

Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor won't fall through again,

But I swore I was fine,
You paint me a blue sky,
Then go back and turn it to rain,
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed the rules everyday,
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight,
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why.

Chorus:
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone,

Verse 2:
Well, maybe it's me,
And my blind optimism to blame,
Or maybe it's you and your sick need,
To give love and take it away,
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors,
Who don't understand,
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said,

Song title is : Holy Ground by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1046:
Verse 1:
I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away,
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time,
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme,
Took off faster than a green light, go,
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know,
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made,
And that was the first day.

Chorus:
And darling, it was good,
Never looking down,
And right there where we stood,
Was holy ground.

Verse 2:
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves,
We blocked the noise with the sound of, I need you,
And for the first time, I had something to lose,
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way,
And the story's got dust on every page,
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now,
And I see your face in every crowd,

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift:
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine,
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine,
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree,
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh.

Verse 2: Taylor Swift:
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles,
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love,
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life,
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of.

Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift:
But now that we're done and it's over,
I bet you couldn't believe,
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave,
And I bet you think about me.

Verse 3: Taylor Swift:
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community,
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills,
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion,
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills.

Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton:
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for,
And you and I fell like an early spring snow,
But reality crept in, you said we're too different,

Verse 5: Taylor Swift:
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul,
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old,
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free,
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me.

Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift:

Heartbreak is the national anthem,
We sing it proudly,
We are too busy dancing,
To get knocked off our feet,

The best people in life are free.

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding,
We hang back, it's all in the timing,
It's poker, he can't see it in my face,

'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on.

Pre-Chorus:
Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to fallout,
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up, I can't break through.

Chorus:
Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room,
And we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know,
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah,
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate,
When it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

How'd we end up this way?,
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
And you're doing your best to avoid me,
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us,
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
But you held your pride like you should've held me.

Pre-Chorus:
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing?,
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how,
I've never heard silence quite this loud.

Chorus:

And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

Bridge:
This is looking like a contest,
Of who can act like they care less,
But I liked it better when you were on my side,
The battle's in your hands now,
But I would lay my armor down,
If you said you'd rather love than fight,
Pre-Chorus:
So many things that you wish I knew,
But the story of us might be ending soon.

These are the song lyrics for song #1059:
Verse 1:
I still remember the look on your face,
Lit through the darkness at 1:58,
The words that you whispered for just us to know,
You told me you loved me,
So why did you go away?,
Away.

Verse 2:
I do recall now, the smell of the rain,
Fresh on the pavement,
I ran off the plane,
That July ninth, the beat of your heart,
It jumps through your shirt,
I can still feel your arms.

Pre-Chorus:
But now I'll go,
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes,
All that I know is I don't know,
How to be something you miss.

I do remember the swing of your step,
The life of the party, you're showing off again,
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in,
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did,
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father,
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets,
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something,
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions.

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day,
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed,
You can plan for a change in the weather and time,
But I never planned on you changing your mind,

So, I'll go,
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes,

Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins,
Lost I was born, lonesome I came,

Free as these birds, light as whispers,
Carolina knows.

And she's in my dreams.

And there are places I will never, ever go,
And things that only Carolina will ever know.

Indelible scars, pivotal marks,

Song title is : Forever Winter (Taylor’s Version) From the Vault:  by Taylor Swift:
[Verse 1:
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days,
He says, Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?,
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be,
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity.

Pre-Chorus:
I call, just checking up on him,
He's up, 3 AM, pacing,
He says, It's not just a phase I'm in,
My voice comes out begging.

Chorus:
All this time, I didn't know,
You were breaking down,
I'd fall to pieces on the floor,
If you weren't around,
Too young to know it gets better,
I'll be summer sun for you forever,
Forever winter if you go.

Verse 2:
He seems fine most of the time,
Forcing smiles and never minds,
His laugh is a symphony,
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe,
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head,
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead,

Intro:

Verse 1:
You were in college working part time waitin' tables,
Left a small town, never looked back,
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling,
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts.

Pre-Chorus:
I say, Can you believe it?,
As we're lyin' on the couch,
The moment I could see it,
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Chorus:
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?,
You put your arm around me for the first time,
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Verse 2:
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together,
And there's a drawer of my things at your place,
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes,

You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Post-Chorus:
Oh-oh, oh-oh.

Bridge:
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM,
As everything was slipping right out of our hands,
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street,
Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known,
Then you took me by surprise,
You said, I'll never leave you alone,
Chorus:
You said, I remember how we felt sitting by the water,
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time,
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter,
She is the best thing that's ever been mine.

Song title is : Red by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1064:
Verse 1:
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street,
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly,
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall,
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.

Chorus:
Losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark gray, all alone,
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met,
But loving him was red.

Post-Chorus:
(Red, red),
(Red, red),
Loving him was red,
(Red, red),
(Red, red).

Verse 2:
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you,
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song,
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer,
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong.

Chorus:
Losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa),
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met,
But loving him was red,

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go,
But moving on from him is impossible,
When I still see it all in my head,
In burning red,
Burning, it was red.

Chorus:
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa),
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met,
'Cause loving him was red.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, Hello,
Little did I know.

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet,
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, Please don't go, and I said.

Song title is : Better Than Revenge by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1069:
Intro:
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did,
Ha, time for a little revenge.

Verse 1:
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and,
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him,
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause,
She took him faster than you can say Sabotage,
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it,
I underestimated just who I was dealing with,
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum,
She underestimated just who she was stealing from.

Chorus:
She's not a saint and she's not what you think,
She's an actress, woah,
She's better known for the things that she does,
On the mattress, woah,
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,
On the playground won't make you many friends,
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind,
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha.

Verse 2:
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list,
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it,
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and,
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things,
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me,
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity,
(Think about what you did),

Bridge:
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey,
You might have him, but haven't you heard?,
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey,
You might have him, but I always get the last word,
Woah, woah-ah-oh.

Chorus:
She's not a saint and she's not what you think,
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it),
She's better known for the things that she does,
On the mattress, woah,
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,
On the playground won't make you many friends,
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind,
There is nothing I do better than revenge,
Outro:
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no),
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No),
I don't think you do, I don't think you do,
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on),
Come on, show me how much better you are,
(So much better, yeah?),
See, you deserve some applause,
'Cause you're so much better,
She took him faster than you could say Sabotage.

Verse 1:
Put your lips close to mine,
As long as they don't touch,

And I'll do anything you say,
If you say it with your hands,
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand.

Song title is : Back to December by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1074:
Verse 1:
I'm so glad you made time to see me,
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?,
I haven't seen them in a while,
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why.

Pre-Chorus:
Because the last time you saw me,
Is still burned in the back of your mind,
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

Chorus:
So, this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying, I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright,
I go back to December all the time.

Verse 2:
These days, I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up, playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call,
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side,
And realized I loved you in the fall,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likePre-Chorus:
And then the cold came, the dark days,
When fear crept into my mind,

Standing in front of you, saying, I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind,
I go back to December all the time.

Bridge:
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry,
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right,
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't,
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand.

Chorus:
But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying, I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright,
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind,
I go back to December all the time,

Song title is : If You’re Anything Like Me Poem:  by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1075:
Poem:  LyricsIf you're anything like me,,
You bite your nails,,
And laugh when you're nervous.,
You promise people the world,,
because that's what they want from you.,
You like giving them what they want...,
But darling, you need to stop,.

If you're anything like me,,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.,
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes,
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.,
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...,
If life gets too good now,,
Darling, it scares you.,
If you're anything like me,,
You never wanted to lock your door,,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer,
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore,
For fear she was much better before...,
But Darling, now you have to..

If you're anything like me,,
There's a justice system in your head,
For names you'll never speak again,,
And you make your ruthless rulings.,
Each new enemy turns to steel,
They become the bars that confine you,,
In your own little golden prison cell...,
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165If you're anything like me,
You've grown to hate your pride,
To love your thighs,
And no amount of friends at 25,
Will fill the empty seats,
At the lunch tables of your past,
The teams that picked you last...,
But Darling, you keep trying..

If you're anything like me,,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love,
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint,
Threw your victory flag away,
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...,
Darling, later on you will thank your stars,
for that frightful day..

If you're anything like me,,
I'm sorry..

But Darling, it's going to be okay..

Song title is : Red (Taylor’s Version) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1076:
Verse 1:
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street,
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly,
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall,
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.

Chorus:
Losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah),
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met,
But loving him was red (Red, red),
(Red, red),
But loving him was red (Red, red),
(Red, red).

Verse 2:
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you,
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song,
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer,
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong.

Chorus:
Losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah),
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met,
But loving him was red (Red, red),
Oh, red (Red, red),
Burning red (Red, red),
(Red, red),

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes,
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go,
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head,
In burning red,
Burning, it was red.

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah),
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met,

Oh, burning red (Red, red),

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red),
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red),

Yeah, yeah (Red, red).

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around,
We shouldn't be in this town,

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation,

Song title is : Reputation Prologue:  by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1080:
Prologue:  LyricsHere's something I've learned about people..

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip..

This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you..

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.,
When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?.

Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...,
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us..

There will be no further explanation.

There will be just reputation.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

СрпскиFrançaisSparks Fly LyricsVerse 1:
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards,
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin',
But I kinda know that I won't get far,
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch,
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of.

Chorus:
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain,
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile,
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down,
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around,
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.

Verse 2:
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea,
You touch me once and it's really somethin',
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be,
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world,
But with you, I know it's no good,
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would.

Chorus:
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain,
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile,
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down,

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild,
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right,
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?,
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

Chorus:
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain,

СрпскиEspañolFrançaisNeed LyricsVerse 1:
Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket,
You wore to the wrong part of town,
Desire is the sound of the whiskey,
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?.

Pre-Chorus:
Passion is a passing thing,
It's accidental chemistry,
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire,
It ain't what you and I are at all.

Chorus:
Oh, it's a need, it's a need,
I would go anywhere that you lead,
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow,
Touch me, hold me, tell me, I won't let you go,
I won't leave, it's a need.

Verse 2:
Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck,
That tell me to run or to freeze,
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else,
You forgot about me.

Pre-Chorus:
Passion is a passing thing,
It's accidental chemistry,
Caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving,
This is like breathing for me,

It keeps me awake, the look on your face,

The wrong ones think they’re right,
You were outnumbered this time.

And the big bad man and his big bad clan,
Their hands are stained with red,
Oh, how quickly they forget.

Verse 1:
New to town with a made-up name,
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame,
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream,
You had it figured out since you were in school,
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool,
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen.

Pre-Chorus 1:
Another name goes up in lights,
Like diamonds in the sky.

Chorus 1:
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one,
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one,

Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you,
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page,
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused,
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used,
And all the young things line up to take your place,

It was a few years later, I showed up here,
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,

The jury's out, but my choice is you.

People throw rocks at things that shine,

Verse 1:
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors,
It's the mornin' of your very first day,
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while,
Try and stay out of everybody's way,
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here,
For the next four years in this town,
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
You know, I haven't seen you around before.

Chorus:
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,
You're gonna believe them,
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out,
Well, count to ten, take it in,
This is life before you know who you're gonna be,
Fifteen.

Verse 2:
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail,
And soon enough, you're best friends,
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool,

And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car,
And you're feelin' like flyin',
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one,
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends,

But I didn't know it at fifteen.

Bridge:
When all you wanted was to be wanted,
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now,
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday,
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,
And Abigail gave everything she had,
To a boy who changed his mind,
And we both cried.

Chorus:
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,
You're gonna believe them,
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall,
I've found time can heal most anything,
And you just might find who you're supposed to be,
I didn't know who I was supposed to be,
At fifteen,

Verse 1:
He is sensible and so incredible,
And all my single friends are jealous,

He opens up my door and I get into his car,
And he says you look beautiful tonight,
And I feel perfectly fine.

And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name,

In the front seat of his car,
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,

How we don't have a song,
And he says.

Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window,
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,

The first date: Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have,
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen,
Askin' God if he could play it again.

I was walking up the front porch steps,
After everything that day,
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away,

To my lovin' bed,

But they all lead back to you.

Verse 1:
He said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,
I said, That's a lie,

That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,
On backroads at night,
And I was right there beside him all summer long,
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone.

Chorus:
But when you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song,
The one we danced to all night long,
The moon like a spotlight on the lake,
When you think happiness,
I hope you think that little black dress,
Think of my head on your chest,
And my old faded blue jeans,
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me.

Verse 2:
September saw a month of tears,
And thankin' God that you weren't here,
To see me like that,
But in a box beneath my bed,
Is a letter that you never read,
From three summers back,
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet,
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe,

We said, No one else,
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe),

Song title is : We Were Happy (Taylor’s Version) From the Vault:  by Taylor Swift:
[Verse 1:
We used to walk along the streets,
When the porch lights were shining bright,
Before I had somewhere to be,
Back when we had all night and we were happy,
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus,
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it,
And we were happy.

Chorus:
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby,
We showed 'em all up,
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark,
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday,
And we were happy.

Verse 2:
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water,
That's sorta how I feel right now,
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy.

Chorus:
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby,
We showed 'em all up,
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark,
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday,
And we were happy,

The night we snuck into a yacht club party,
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince.

Verse 1:
I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marrying the wrong girl,
I sneak in and see your friends,
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry.

Pre-Chorus:
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say.

Chorus:
Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church, at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, Speak now.

And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march,

Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only lookin' at you,

It wasn't just like a movie,
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin,

This is the last time I'll drive this way again,
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray,
'Cause I, I still love you, but I can't.

Chorus:
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side,
Bye, bye, baby,
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing,
And all I have is your sympathy,
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me,
Bye, bye, baby,
Bye, bye, baby.

The picture frame is empty,
On the dresser, vacant just like me,
I see your writing on the dash,
Then back to your hesitation,
I was so sure of everything,
Everything I thought we'd always have,
Guess I never doubted it,
Then the here and the now floods in,
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past,

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye,
And we caught onto something,
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me,
Were you just kidding?,
'Cause it seems to me,
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak,
I don't feel welcome anymore,
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me,
'Cause one second, it was perfect,
Now you're halfway out the door.

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called,
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all,
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always,
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom,
Everything is wrong,
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,
'Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always.

Verse 2:
Was I out of line?,
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide,
Like a scared little boy?,
I looked into your eyes,
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure,
So here's to everything coming down to nothing,
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core,
Where is this going?,

Follow me home if you dare to,

Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?,
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start,
With no beauty in my memory.

Chorus:
All that I wanted was to be wanted,
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted,
Born into nothing,
At least you have something, something to cling to,
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into,
And the memories were lost long ago,
But at least you have beautiful ghosts.

Verse 2:
Perilous night, their voices calling,
A flicker of light before the dawning,
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me,
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again,
Is this hope just a mystical dream?.

Verse 1:
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway,
I remember your little laugh,
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs,
I love you to the moon and back,
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine,
Like we had our own secret club,
I remember you dancing before bed time,
Then jumping on me waking me up,
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man,
And even the moment I knew,
You fought it hard like an army guy,
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you.

Chorus:
Come on, baby, with me,
We're going to fly away from here,
You were my best four years.

Verse 2:
I remember the drive home,
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, Why?,
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say,
About a beautiful boy who died,
And it's about to be Halloween,
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here,
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face,
And whispered in your ear,

Come on, baby, with me,
We're going to fly away from here,
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey,
We'll just disappear,
Come on, baby, with me,
We're going to fly away from here,
You were my best four years.

Bridge:
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?,
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?,
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?,
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?.

Chorus:
Come on, baby, with me,
We're going to fly away from here,
Come on, baby, with me,
We're going to fly away from here,
You were my best four years.

Outro:
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway,
I love you to the moon and back.

Song title is : The Best Day by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1118:
Verse 1:
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on,
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run,
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides,
Look now, the sky is gold,
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home.

Chorus:
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall,
But I know you're not scared of anything at all,
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away,
But I know I had the best day with you today.

Verse 2:
I'm thirteen now,
And don't know how my friends could be so mean,
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys,
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names.

Chorus:
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school,
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay,
But I know I had the best day with you today,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likeBridge:
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger,
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out,
He's better than I am,
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run,
And I had the best days with you.

Verse 3:
There is a video I found from back when I was three,
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me,
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs,
And Daddy's smart,
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world.

Chorus:
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall,
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong,
And I love you for giving me your eyes,
For staying back and watching me shine,
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say,
That I had the best day with you today.

Song title is : Red (Original Demo Recording) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1119:
Verse 1:
Loving him is like,
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly,
Loving him is like,
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall,
Like the colors in autumn,
So bright, just before they lose it all,
Chorus:
Losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark grey, all alone,
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met,
But loving him was red,
Loving him was red,
Verse 2:
Touching him was like,
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you,
Memorizing him was as,
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song,
Fighting with him was like,
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer,
Regretting him was like,
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong,

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met,

Oh, red,
Burning red,
Bridge:
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes,
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go,
But moving on from him is impossible,
When I still see it all in my head,
In burning red,
Burning, it was red,
Chorus:
Losing him was blue like I'd never known,
Missing him was dark grey, all alone,
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met,
'Cause loving him was red,
Yeah, yeah, red,
We're burning red.

Breakdown:
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head,
Burning red, burning red,
Outro:
His love was like,
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street.

Song title is : If This Was a Movie by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1120:
Verse 1:
Last night, I heard my own heart beating,
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs,
Six months gone and I'm still reaching,
Even though I know you're not there,
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby,
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through,
Maybe I've been going back too much lately,
When time stood still and I had you.

Chorus:
Come back, come back, come back to me like,
You would, you would if this was a movie,
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out,
Come back, come back, come back to me like,
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry,
I know that we could work it out somehow,
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now.

Verse 2:
I know people change and these things happen,
But I remember how it was back then,
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin',
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street,
Flashback to the night when you said to me,
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
Back before I knew how much I had to lose,

I know that we could work it out somehow,
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now.

Bridge:
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on,
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone,
I just want it back the way it was before,
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.

Chorus:
And I say, Come back, come back, come back to me like,
You would before you said it's not that easy,
Before the fight, before I locked you out,
But I take it all back now.

Chorus:
Come back, come back, come back to me like,

СрпскиFrançaisAfrikaansShould’ve Said No LyricsVerse 1:
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing,
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone,
Yesterday, I found out about you,
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong.

Pre-Chorus:
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance,
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said yes.

Chorus:
You should've said no, you should've gone home,
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go,
You should've known that word,
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me),
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind,
I shouldn't be asking myself why,
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet,
You should've said no,
Baby, and you might still have me.

Verse 2:
You can see that I've been cryin',
And baby, you know all the right things to say,
But do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?,

Verse 1:
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving,
But I know I saw a light in you,
And as we walked, we were talking,
I didn't say half the things I wanted to,
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window,
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold,
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing,
I don't always have to be alone.

Chorus:
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so,
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you,
Can't help it if there's no one else,
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Verse 2:
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling,
So I got some things to say to you, ha,
I've seen it all, so I thought,
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do,
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name,
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change,
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?,
I think you and I should stay the same,

These are the song lyrics for song #1125:
Verse 1:
You have a way of coming easily to me,
And when you take, you take the very best of me,
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something,
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted.

Chorus:
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day,
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say,
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you.

Verse 2:
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray,
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away,
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.

Chorus:
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day,
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say,

These are the song lyrics for song #1127:
Verse 1:
She said I was seven and you were nine,
I looked at you like the stars that shined,
In the sky, the pretty lights,
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,
Growing up and falling in love,
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,
And said, Oh, my, my, my.

Chorus:
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree,
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me,
You never did, you never did,
Take me back when our world was one block wide,
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried,
Just two kids, you and I,
Oh, my, my, my, my.

Verse 2:
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly,
I wasn't that little girl you used to see,
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights,
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,
They never believed we'd really fall in love,
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,
And said, Oh, my, my, my,

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up,
2 a.m. riding in your truck,
And all I need is you next to me,
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight,
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight,
You stayed outside 'til the morning light,
Oh, my, my, my, my.

Bridge:
A few years had gone and come around,
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me, got down on one knee.

Chorus:
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle,
Our whole town came and our mamas cried,
You said, I do, and I did, too,
Take me home where we met so many years before,
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch,
After all this time, you and I.

Outro:
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine,
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine,
In the sky, oh, my, my, my.

Song title is : Back to December / Apologize / You’re Not Sorry (Live/2011) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1128:
Verse 1:
I'm so glad you made time to see me,
How's life, tell me, how's your family,
I haven't seen them in a while,
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause the last time you saw me,
Is still burned in the back of your mind,
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

Chorus:
So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I'd go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright,
I go back to December all the time.

Verse 2:
These days I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call,
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and,
Realized I loved you in the fall,

And then the cold came, the dark days,
When fear crept into my mind,
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.

Chorus:
So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I'd go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind,
I go back to December all the time.

Bridge:
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry,
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right,
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't,
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...,
And then he said, It's too late to apologize,
It's too late...,
He said, It's too late to apologize,
It's too late...,
Chorus:
So this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize),
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night (It's too late),
And I go back to December (It's too late to apologize, it's too late),
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you (It's too late to apologize),
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine (It's too late),
Oh.

I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me,
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy,
That's fine,  I'll  tell  mine you're gay,
And  by the way.

Chorus:

You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying,
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time,
As far as I'm concerned, you're just anothеr picture to burn.

Verse 2:
There's no timе for tears,
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge,
There's nothing stopping me,
From going out with all of your best friends,
And if you come around saying sorry to me,
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be.

Chorus:

These are the song lyrics for song #1130:
Verse 1:
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around,
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down,
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out,
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around.

Chorus:
You don't have to call anymore,
I won't pick up the phone,
This is the last straw,
Don't wanna hurt anymore,
And you can tell me that you're sorry,
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before,
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no).

Verse 2:
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know,
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold,
And you've got your share of secrets,
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh,
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before.

Chorus:
But you don't have to call anymore,
I won't pick up the phone,

These are the song lyrics for song #1144:
Verse 1:
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset,
She's going off about something that you said,
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do,
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night,
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like,
And she'll never know your story like I do.

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts,
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers,
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find,
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

Chorus:
If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you,
Been here all along, so why can't you see?,
You bеlong with me, you belong with me.

Verse 2:
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans,
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be,
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself,
Hey, isn't this easy?,
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town,
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down,
You say you're fine, I know you better than that,
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?,

Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Will you ever know?.

The highlight of my day,

One night, a few moons ago,
I saw flecks of what could've been lights,

And time can't stop me quite like you did,
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking,
I'm unglued, thanks to you.

These are the song lyrics for song #1170:
СрпскиPortuguêsMagyarPolskiAfrikaansFrançaisFifteen (Taylor’s Version) LyricsVerse 1:
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors,
It's the mornin' of your very first day,
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while,
Try and stay out of everybody's way,
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here,
For the next four years in this town,
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
You know, I haven't seen you around before.

Chorus:
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,
You're gonna believe them,
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out,
Well, count to ten, take it in,
This is life before you know who you're gonna be,
At fifteen.

Verse 2:
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail,
And soon enough, you're best friends,
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool,
We'll be outta here as soon as we can,
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car,
And you're feelin' like flyin',
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one,
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends,
When the night ends,

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,
You're gonna believe them,
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss,
Makes your head spin around, well,
In your life you'll do things greater than,
Datin' the boy on the football team,
I didn't know it at fifteen.

Bridge:
When all you wanted was to be wanted,
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now,
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday,
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,
And Abigail gave everything she had,
To a boy who changed his mind,
And we both cried.

Chorus:
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,
You're gonna believe them,
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall,
But I've found time can heal most anything,
And you just might find who you're supposed to be,
I didn't know who I was supposed to be,
At fifteen,
Post-Chorus:

Song title is : I Know Places (Voice Memo) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1172:
I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else,
So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called I Know Places,
So this was the voice memo that I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song.

Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:.

Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i,
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i.

Na na na na waiting at the back door,
They're around and the vultures come around,
And you know that they won't, they won't us,
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us,
And you come and sing and listen,
I would not think about it but I'm not done,
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I.

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes,
And guns,
They are the hunters we are the foxes,
And we run,
Baby, I know some places we won't be found,
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down,
'Cause I, I know places we can hide,
I know places, I know places.

Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places.

Or whatever,
I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus,
So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing,
It would be, like, *vocalizing*:
Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds,

When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people,

Song title is : cardigan (voice memo) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1182:
cardigan (voice memo) LyricsSo first of all, I'm obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all  of  them,  so, unbelievable archives,  I can't believe  you have this just, like, laying around, that's ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the Maple one? And I came up with this thing, and it's probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing..

Verse 1:
Vintage tee, brand new phone,
High heels on cobblestones,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing,
Sequin smile, black lipstick,
Sensual politics,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing.

Chorus:
But I knew you,
Dancin' in your Levi's,
Drunk under a streetlight, I,
I knew you,
Hand under my sweatshirt,
Baby, kiss it better, I.

Refrain:
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorite.

Verse 2:
A friend to all is a friend to none,
Chase two girls, lose the one,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likeChorus:
But I knew you,
Living in a gold age,
Sneaking to my bird cage, I,
I knew you,
Laughing like a damn fool,
Breaking every damn rule, I.

Refrain:
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorite.

Instrumental Break:
And then, I have like this-- there's like a break, because I don't really know what's gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think it's here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing..

Bridge:
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars,
Was all we needed,
You drew stars around my scars,
Now I'm bleedin',
I'm bleedin'.

Instrumental Break:
We'll work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, there's all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait 'til then, and then, I start singing again. I don't think it's right now, but... there it is. The ending.,
Chorus:
'Cause I knew you,
Steppin' on the last train,
Marked me like a bloodstain, I,
I knew you,
Tried to change the ending,
Peter leaving Wendy, I,
I knew you,
Dancing in your Levi's,
Drunk under a streetlight, I,
I knew you,
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing.

Verse 3:
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss,
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs,
The smell of smoke would hang around this long,
'Cause I knew everything when I was young,
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time,
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind,
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died,
I knew to love would be to lose my mind.

And then, I don't know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it..

Song title is : Forever & Always (Taylor’s Version) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1183:
Verse 1:
Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye,
And we caught onto something,
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me,
Were you just kidding?,
'Cause it seems to me,
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak,
I don't feel welcome anymore,
Baby, what happened? Please tell me,
'Cause one second it was perfect,
Now you're halfway out the door.

Chorus:
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called,
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all,
And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always,
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong,
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,
'Cause I was there when you said, Forever and always.

Verse 2:
Was I out of line?,
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide,
Like a scared little boy?,
I looked into your eyes,
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure,
So here's to everything coming down to nothing,
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core,
Where is this going?,
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore,

Did you forget everything?.

Song title is : Macavity by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1193:
Verse 1: Taylor Swift:
Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw,
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law,
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair,
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there.

Chorus: Taylor Swift:
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity,
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there.

Verse 2: Taylor Swift:
Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin,
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in,
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed,
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed,
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake,
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake.

Chorus: Taylor Swift:
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity,
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square,
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there,

He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards,
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's,
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled,
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled,
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair,
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there.

Chorus: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba & Both:
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity,
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare,
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there,
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known,
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone,
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time,
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime,
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity,
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square,
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity,
Macavity, Macavity.

Outro: Idris Elba, Taylor Swift:
When a crime's discovered, then,
Macavity's not ther.

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on,
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run,
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides,
Look now, the sky is gold,
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home.

Chorus:
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall,
But I know you're not scared of anything at all,
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away,
But I know I had the best day with you today.

Verse 2:
I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean,
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys,
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names.

Chorus:
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school,
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay,
But I know I had the best day with you today.

Chorus:
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall,
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong,
And I love you for giving me your eyes,
For staying back and watching me shine,

So I'm taking this chance to say,
That I had the best day with you today.

Repeating history and you're getting sick of it,
But I believe in whatever you do,

Oh, oh.

You can walk away, say we don't need this,
But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this.

The time we stood with our shaking hands,
The crowds in stands went wild,
We were the kings and the queens,
And they read off our names,
The night  you  danced  like you knew  our lives,
Would never  be the same,
You held your head like a hero,
On a history book page,
It was the end of a decade,
But the start of an age.

Chorus:
Long live the walls we crashed through,
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remembered.

Verse 2:
I said, remember this feeling,
I passed the pictures around,
Of all the years that we stood there,
On the side-lines wishing for right now,
We are the kings and the queens,
You traded your baseball cap for a crown,
When they gave us our trophies,
And we held them up for our town,
And the cynics were outraged,
Screaming, This is absurd,
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves,
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world,

I was screaming, long live all the magic we made,
And bring on all the pretenders,
I'm not afraid,
Long live all the mountains we moved,
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,
I was screaming, long live that look on your face,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remembered.

Bridge:
Hold on to spinning around,
Confetti falls to the ground,
May these memories break our fall.

Spoken Interlude:
We have absolutely loved spending time in your town, and you have been so amazing to us,
I mean, you guys know every single word and you’ve danced this entire night and it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage,
Thank you.

Breakdown:
Will you take a moment?,
And Promise me this,
That you'll stand by me forever,
But if, God forbid, fate should step in,
And force us into a goodbye,
If you have children some day,
When they point to the pictures,
Please tell ‘em my name,
Tell them how the crowds went wild,
Tell them how I hope they shine,
Long live the walls we crashed through,
I had the time of my life, with you,
Chorus:
Long, long live the walls we crashed through,
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made,
And bring on all the pretenders,
I'm not afraid,
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved,
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,
Long, long live that look on your face,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remember.

СрпскиEnglishPortuguêsAfrikaansState Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor’s Version) LyricsVerse 1:
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights,
Busy streets and busy lives,
And all we know is touch and go,
We are alone with our changing minds,
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds,
Or fades in time.

Chorus:
And I never saw you comin',
And I'll never be the same.

Verse 2:
You come around and the armor falls,
Pierce the room like a cannonball,
Now all we know is don't let go,
We are alone, just you and me,
Up in your room and our slates are clean,
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes.

Pre-Chorus:
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong,
Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts,
But this love is brave and wild.

Song title is : I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1208:
I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds.,
And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me,
And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called I Wish You Would, because Jack wrote back and said I love that,
So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:.

Okay so this is an idea called I Wish You Would. It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hates him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this,
It's 2 am, in your car,
Windows down, past my street the memories start,
It's in the past,
You drive straight ahead,
You thinking that I hate you now,
'Cause you still don't know what I never said.

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did,
I wish you knew that,
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I,
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good,
I wish you would.

Last Christmas I gave you my heart,

Once bitten and twice shied,
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye,
Tell me baby,
Do you recognize me,
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me,

With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it,
Now I know what a fool I've been,
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again.

A girl on a cover but you tore her apart,
Maybe this year,
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special.

Forcing laughter, faking smiles,
Same old tired, lonely place,
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy,
Vanished when I saw your face,
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you.

Verse 2:
Your eyes whispered,  Have  we  met?,
Across the room  your silhouette,
Starts to  make it’s way to me,
The playful conversation starts,
Counter all your quick remarks,
Like passing notes in secrecy,
And it was enchanting to meet you,
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you.

Song title is : folklore Foreword:  by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1214:
folklore Foreword:  LyricsIt started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity..

Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of let's run away and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate..

Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I've never met, people I've known, or those I wish I hadn't. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out..

A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold..

In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I've told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve..

Now it's up to you to pass them down.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't trying to show maturity.

Chorus:
X is the shape I drew through your face,
In permanent marker, oh, yeah,
Just like the mark you knew you were making,
Who do you think you are,
To write on his heart in permanent marker?.

Verse 2:
I found that picture of you in that green dress,
He sure had a good time cleaning up that mess,
He found thirty other pieces but he'll never find them all,
Tried to tape it back together, now he knows to keep it off the wall.

The tricky thing,

Playing soldiers, just pretending,

Winning battles with our wooden swords,
But now we've stepped into a cruel world,
Where everybody stands and keeps score.

These are the song lyrics for song #1217:
- Recorded At Long Pond Studios LyricsVerse 1:
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now.

Verse 2:
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze,
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate,
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

Pre-Chorus:
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again on that little town street,
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me,
Wind in my hair, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

Verse 3:
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red,
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me,
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy,
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town,
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, Any time now,
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was,
'Til we were dead and gone and buried,
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same,
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,
Down the stairs, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And there we are again when nobody had to know,
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath,
Sacred prayer and we'd swear,
To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh.

Bridge:
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up,
Runnin' scared, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest,
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here,
'Cause I remember it all, all, all,
Verse 4:
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell,
Every time you double-cross my mind,
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine,
And that made me want to die,
The idea you had of me, who was she?,
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you,
Not weepin' in a party bathroom,
Some actress askin' me what happened, you,
That's what happened, you,
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes,
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show,
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come,
And he said, It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one.

Verse 5:
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it,
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it,
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,
You can't get rid of it,
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, you were there,
You remember it all,
Down the stairs, you were there,
You remember it all,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Verse 6:
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes,
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age,
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones,
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight,
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?,
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?,
'Cause in this city's barren cold,
I still remember the first fall of snow,
And how it glistened as it fell,
I remember it all too well.

Outro:
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?,
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?,
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well,
Just between us, I remember it,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there),
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there),
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there),
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it (All too well),
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh),
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it.

'Cause it seems to me,
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak,
I don't feel welcome anymore,
What happened? Please, tell me,
'Cause one second it was perfect,
Now you're halfway out the door.

And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong,
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,
I was there when you said, Forever and always.

Was I out of line?,
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide,
Like a scared little boy?,

Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure,

Song title is : I’d Lie by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1222:
Verse 1:
I don't think that passenger seat,
Has ever looked this good to me,
He tells me about his night,
And I count the colors in his eyes,
He'll never fall in love, he swears,
As he runs his fingers through his hair,
I’m laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong,
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind,
He tells a joke, I fake a smile,
But I know all his favorite songs.

Chorus:
And I could tell you his favorite color's green,
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth,
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes,
And if you asked me if I love him,
I'd lie.

Verse 2:
He looks around the room,
Innocently overlooks the truth,
Shouldn't a light go on?,
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?,
He sees everything in black and white,
Never let nobody see him cry,
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine,

Bridge:
He stands there, then walks away,
My God, if I could only say,
I'm holding every breath for you,
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar,
I think he can see through everything but my heart,
First thought when I wake up,
Is, My God, he’s beautiful,
So I put on my makeup,
And pray for a miracle.

Chorus:
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green,
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me,
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes,
And if you asked me if I love him,
If you asked me if I love him,

Verse 1:
She walks to school,
With her arms crossed,
It's just another day,
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming,
Then finally she sees them,
It's scary how things change,
And I saw the story on the news,
I saw the footage from the roof,
I sat down and cried.

Chorus:
Didn't she call you,
Didn't she need you bad enough,
Was there some reason,
I'm not aware of,
Did you not write it down,
Just one more thing to do,
Where were you,
And didn't she pray too.

Verse 2:
He kissed his wife goodbye,
And took the earliest flight,
So he could be home that night,
To put his kids to sleep,
Down the aisle,
Three men walked and said,
We're here to die for our God,
He stood up and said that's funny,
Cause my God died for me,
I put the magazine down,
I read his words out loud,
I sat down and cried,

They rode 100 floors up,
Just to come back down,
They never thought they'd see the day,

Song title is : Lover Foreword:  by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1225:
Foreword:  LyricsWhen I found old diaries from my childhood and my teens, they were covered in dust. I'm not just saying that for poetic effect, they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments. I'd practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small chance of ever attaining..

But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were..

In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love..

I've decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things I'm afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but they're not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didn't. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, it's someone who deserves you. If that's the case, I hope you treat them with care..

This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it (that's why there are so many songs).,
In honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.,
We are what we love.,

Song title is : The Trick to Holding On Poem:  by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1226:
Poem:  LyricsLet go of the ones who hurt you,
Let go of the ones you outgrow,
Let go of the words they hurl your way,
as you're walking out the door,
The only thing cut and dry,
In this hedge-maze life,
Is the fact that their words will cut,
but your tears will dry.

They don't tell you this when you are young,
You can't hold on to everything,
Can't show up for everyone,
You pick your poison,
Or your cure,
Phone numbers you know by heart,
And the ones you don't answer any more.

Hold on to the faint recognition in,
the eye of a stranger,
As it catches you in its lustrous net,
How quickly we become intertwined,
How wonderful it is to forget,
All the times your intuition failed you,
But it hasn't killed you yet,
Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight,
swims and your blazing self-respect,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165And if you drive the roads of this town,
Ones you've gone down so many times before,
Flashback to all the times,
Life nearly ran you off the road,
But tonight your hand is steady,
Suddenly you'll know,
The trick to holding on,
Was all that letting go.

Enchanted:
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go,
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home,
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew,
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go,
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone,
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew,
I was enchanted to meet you.

Wildest Dreams:
He said let's get out of this town,
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds,
I thought heaven can't help me now,
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down,
He's so tall and handsome as hell,
He's so bad but he does it so well,
I can see the end as it begins,
My one condition is,
Say you'll remember me,
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe,
Red lips and rosy cheeks,
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your,
Wildest dreams (ah ah),
Wildest dreams (ah ah),
He said no one has to know what we do,
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room,
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothing lasts forever,
But this is getting good now,
He's so tall and handsome as hell,
He's so bad but he does it so well,
And when we've had our very last kiss,
My last request is,
Say you'll remember me,
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe,
Red lips and rosy cheeks,
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your,

Song title is : Dear John (Live/2011) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1228:
Verse 1:
Long were the nights when,
My days once revolved around you,
Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor won't fall through again,
And my mother accused me of losing my mind,
But I swore I was fine,
You paint me a blue sky,
Then go back and turn it to rain,
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed your rules everyday,
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight,
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why.

Chorus:
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone,
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home,
I shoulda' known.

Verse 2:
Well maybe it's me,
And my blind optimism to blame,
Or maybe it's you and your sick need,
To give love and take it away,
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors,
Who don't understand,
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
Run as fast as you can,

Bridge:
You are an expert at sorry,
And keeping the lines blurry,
Never impressed by me acing your tests,
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes,
'Cause you burned them out,
But I took your matches,
Before fire could catch me,
So don't look now,
I'm shining like fireworks,
Over your sad empty town, yeah-yeah,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

While I bathe in cliffside pools,
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief,

Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade,

And I said she was crazy,
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar,
Just me and Britney.

Chorus:
Oh, oh,
We were babies, we were beautiful and free,
Oh, oh,
There was nothing that was out of reach,
For me and Britney.

Verse 2:
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis,
And this little old town just hasn’t been the same since,
That boy she ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy,
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney.

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye,
We caught onto something,
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me,
Were you just kidding?,
'Cause it seems to me,
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak,
I don't feel welcome anymore,
Baby, what happened? Please tell me,
'Cause one second it was perfect,
Now you're halfway out the door.

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called,
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all,

I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind,
The time we stood with our shaking hands,

We were the Kings and the Queens,
And they read off our names,
The night you danced like you knew our lives,
Would never be the same,
You held your head like a hero,
On a history book page,
It was the end of a decade,
But the start of an age.

Chorus 1: Long Live:
Long live the walls we crashed through,
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,
I was screaming long live all the magic we made,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remembered,
Long live all the mountains we moved,
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,
I was screaming long live that look on your face,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remembered.

Song title is : Brought Up That Way by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1235:
Verse 1:
Emily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says Baby girl, what's wrong with you?,
She says Please don't make me go back there again,
She said I wish there was some way to make them stop it,
So he drives down to that principal's office and says.

Chorus:
I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down,
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out,
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile,
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?,
She wasn't brought up that way.

Verse 2:
Emily's home late again,
He sees that boy drive away,
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say,
She said He tried but there's just some things I won't do,
And through the tears she said I couldn't do that to you,
And he said.

Chorus:
I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down,
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out,
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile,
So don't let nobody take that away,
You weren't brought up that way,

The phone rings on a rainy night, says It's Officer Tate,
He said Sir, there's been an accident,
You better come down here right away,
A drunken driver missed an overpass,
And Emily, she's fading fast,
He says God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down,
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground,
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girl's smile,
So please don't take that away, it won't be easy taking her today,
She wasn't brought up that way.

Outro:
He stands over the hospital bed,
Emily opens her eyes.

I laugh, and I play, and I wasn’t gonna stray,
Swore I’d never let a man in my way,
You’re the last thing I needed today.

Chorus:
And I don’t know,
Where I lost control,
And couldn’t take it any longer,
Must have been somewhere between,

You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction,
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction.

'Cause it might be you, you just never know,

When I passed your house,
It's like I couldn't breathe.

I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything,
But I know I miss you.

You come around and the armor falls,
Pierce the room like a cannon ball,

Up in your room and our slates are clean,
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes.

And I wrote this song about it.

Verse 1:
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me,
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out,
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down,
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do.

Chorus:
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on,
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world.

Verse 2:
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve,
I'm feeling lucky today, got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need,
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah,
But that's OK.

Chorus:
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on,
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world,

Song title is : Better Off by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1254:
Verse 1:
I live down the street in a broken down house,
And a car up on blocks in the driveway,
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt,
That we won't forget this Sunday,
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles,
And it all leads to this - our first kiss.

Chorus:
All my friends are saying,
Girl, what are you thinking?,
You're better off,
You're better off without him,
Find yourself another,
Girl, that boy is trouble,
You're better off, you're better off,
They can talk forever, they just don't know better.

Verse 2:
We drive around town in a rusty old truck,
But somehow it feels like we're flying,
Don't want to come down,
But they make it so tough,
Cause everyone we know is trying,
To push us apart, hide it down in our hearts,
And they get what they want cause you're gone,

Verse 3:
You come to my door,
In the pouring rain,
We know what we don't have to say,
You hand me a rose and a note that says,
We don't have to do things their way, oh.

Chorus:
All my friends are saying,
Girl, what are you thinking?,
You're better off, you're better off without him,

Song title is : Better Than Revenge (Live/2011) by Taylor Swift:
 Hey, it's me, leave a message:
These are the song lyrics for song #1255:
Intro:
Hey, it's me, leave a message: make it hot,
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did.

Verse 1:
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and,
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him,
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause,
She took him faster than you can say Sabotage,
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it,
I underestimated just who I was dealing with,
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum,
She underestimated just who she was stealing from.

Chorus:
She's not a saint and she's not what you think,
She's an actress, woah,
She's better known for the things that she does,
On the mattress, woah,
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,
On the playground won't make you many friends,
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind,
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha.

Verse 2:
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list,
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it,
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and,
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things,
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,
But they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me,
No amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity,
(Think about what you did),

Woah, woah-ah-oh,
Come on, come on.

Chorus:

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh,
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,
I don't think you do, I don't think you do,
Let's hear the applause,
See, you deserve some applause,

These are the song lyrics for song #1256:
Verse 1:
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train,
I could say everything's alright,
And I could pretend and say goodbye,
Got your ticket,
Got your suitcase,
Got your leaving smile,
I could say that's the way it goes,
And I could pretend and you won't know,
That I was lying.

Chorus:
Cause I can't stop loving you,
No I can't stop loving you,
No I won't stop loving you,
Why should I?.

Verse 2:
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said,
And I saw you walk across the road,
For maybe the last time I don't know,
Feeling humble,
I heard a rumble,
On the railway track,
And when I hear that whistle blow,
I'll walk away and you won't know,
That I'll be crying,

These are the song lyrics for song #1257:
Spoken Intro:
You know, you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?.

Verse 1:
Well, now he's back in the atmosphere,
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey,
He walks like summer and talks like rain,
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey,
But since his return from the stay on the moon,
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey.

Chorus:
Tell me, did you sail across the sun?,
Did you make it to the Milky Way,
To see the lights are faded,
That heaven is overrated?,
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?,
One without a permanent scar,
And did you miss me,
While you were looking for yourself out there?.

Verse 2:
Well, now he's back from that soul vacation,
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey,
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo,
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey,
Well, now he's back in the atmosphere,
I'm afraid that he might think of me as,
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man,
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land,

And did you miss me,
While you were looking for yourself out there?.

 I need you now,
These are the song lyrics for song #1258:
Verse 1:
I need you now,
Read letters that I wrote on the wall,
And the message that I left when I called,
I need you now,
Words I said drowned out by the rain,
Waiting there for you but you never came.

Pre-Chorus:
My world’s a little colder now,
But I’m keeping warm somehow.

Chorus:
So here you are at my window,
Guess nobody told you,
I don’t need you, don’t need you,
And I waited so frustrated,
Who’s gonna hold you?,
I don’t need you, don’t need you now.

Verse 2:
I need you now,
Words I heard you whisper to me,
We were walking down a one-way street,
You need me now,
That’s what you’ve been telling my friends,
But I’ve come too far to go back there again,

When I saw you there across the room, holding her hand,
I'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you,
But here I am,
Still believing there might come a day,
We'll pick up where we left off.

Chorus:
And by the way your eyes are dancing,
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim,
By the way my heart's still breaking,
It's going to take it a while to love again,
So many things that I forgot to say,
By the way.

Verse 2:
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive,
I guess it's too late,
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night,
Give you one last wave,
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say,
I'm looking good.

Song title is : 30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1261:
the most fun! So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring..

Lesson 1.

I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren't, how you're failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I'm showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I'm training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I'm also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while I'm having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it's healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once..

Lesson 2,
Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life's worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you..

Lesson 3,
Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it's good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It's especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That's GOOD. We'll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That's not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you'll learn from it. Then you'll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it's fine; do you, you're searching..

Lesson 4,
I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day..

Lesson 5.

Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn't cruel. It's just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it..

Lesson 6.

I've learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren't allowed to age. It's an impossible standard to meet, and I've been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we're supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn't even remotely required of men.,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165Lesson 7.

My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I've ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I've witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.,
Lesson 8.

I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn't real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want..

Lesson 9,
I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm's cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016.,
Lesson 10,
I've always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I'll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten's Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson's Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver's Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I'm pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex.),
Lesson 11.

Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I'd hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape..

Lesson 12,
Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it's so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say I'm sorry, but... and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.,
Lesson 13,
It's my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying This happened to me. It's something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don't.,
Lesson 14.

When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you've never dealt with before, it's okay to say that you don't know what to say. Sometimes just saying you're so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It's okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don't have all the answers. However, it's not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they're at their lowest point. Even if you can't really help the situation, it's nice for them to know that you would if you could..

Lesson 15.

Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy..

Lesson 16,
Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don't know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn't gold, and first impressions actually aren't everything. It's impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a solid first 15), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they've seen you broken? Or after they've walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they're people? These are things a first impression could never convey..

Lesson 17,
After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can't I be soft during all the seasons?!.

Lesson 18.

Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It's important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them..

Lesson 19.

Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you don't tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.,
Lesson 20.

Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about we're in our young twenties! hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they'll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It's sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you'll always keep the memories..

Lesson 21.

Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don't look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you're doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.,
Lesson 22,
How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you're not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren't trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there's a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who won the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say Hey, same team. Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don't give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers..

Lesson 23,
I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don't care if I'm #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they're here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I'll never forget the ones who stuck around.,
Lesson 24.

I've had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It's taught me that there are real problems and then there's everything else. My mom's cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.,
Lesson 25.

I remember people asking me, What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy? There's a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I'm really grateful to have learned this isn't true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool..

Lesson 26,
I make countdowns for things I'm excited about. When I've gone through dark, low times, I've always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they're free) and adding things I'm looking forward to. Even if they're not big holidays or anything, it's good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it's good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things..

Lesson 27,
I learned that disarming someone's petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I've come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I've ever felt in my life, but I can't tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It's the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll's hateful Instagram comment with lol. It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I'll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it..

Lesson 28.

I'm finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I'm going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year..

Lesson 29.

I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It's the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they've left me. Please pray for their safe return..

Lesson 30.

My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I'd lock myself in my room and couldn't forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I've made a mistake, whether it's self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I've come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go..

Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby,

Think of all the fun I have missed,
Think of all the boys I have not kissed,
Next year I could be just as good,
If you check off my Christmas list.

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot,
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby,
So hurry down the chimney tonight,
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed,

So hurry down the chimney tonight.

Song title is : Your Anything by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1263:
Verse 1:
I bet you lie awake at night,
Trying to make up your sweet mind,
Wondering if you'll ever find,
Just what you want,
A home-town number one,
Or a California loaded gun,
But you know you only get one,
Or that's what you thought,
But here's what you've got.

Chorus:
I could be your favorite blue jeans,
With the holes in the knees,
In the bottom of the top drawer,
I could be your little beauty queen,
Just a little outta reach,
Or the girl living next door,
I'll be your angel giving up her wings,
If that's what you need,
I'd give everything to be your anything.

Verse 2:
If you want hard to get,
If you want,
All you have to do is let me know,
If you want a bumpy ride,
Or someone with a softer side,
Either one will be alright,
Just let me know,
Cause this is where it goes,

Verse 1:
I wake up,
I stretch out,
I wonder what you're doin' right now,
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again,
Tell myself 'I must be crazy',
Thinkin' 'bout him,
I find myself something decent to wear,
Take the towel out of my hair,
About that time, you call me,
And I'm reminded, without you.

Waiting for a love to find her,
Lonely like a harbor light,

Song title is : Christmases When You Were Mine by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1266:
Verse 1:
Please take down the mistletoe,
'Cause I don't want to think about that right now,
'Cause everything I want is miles away,
In a snow covered little town,
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me,
Season's greetings, hope you're well,
Well I'm doing alright,
If you were wondering,
Lately I can never tell.

Chorus:
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time,
But there were Christmases when you were mine.

Verse 2:
I've been doing fine without you, really,
Up until the nights got cold,
And everybody's here, except you, baby,
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold.

Chorus:
But for me it's just a lonely time,
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine.

Verse 3:
Merry Christmas, everybody,
That'll have to be something I just say this year,
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater,
And were your cousins late again?,
When you were putting up the lights this year,
Did you notice one less pair of hands?,

Song title is : Long Time Going by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1267:
Verse 1:
I got a lying smile I never put out for you,
'Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to,
And they say little girls have big dreams,
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you.

Chorus:
And it was a long time coming,
I waited half my life just to find someone like you,
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out,
Not knowing it'd be a long time going.

Verse 2:
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all,
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall,
And they say little girls are so naive,
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you.

Chorus:
And it was a long time coming,
I waited half my life just to find someone like you,
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out,
Not knowing it will be a long time going.

Washed my sins on the neon lights,

Song title is : Back To December (Acoustic) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1268:
Verse 1:
I'm so glad you made time to see me,
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?,
I haven't seen them in a while,
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why.

Pre-Chorus:
Because the last time,
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind,
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

Chorus:
So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright,
I go back to December all the time.

Verse 2:
These days, I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call,
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side,
And realized I loved you in the fall,

I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind,
I go back to December all the time.

Bridge:
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry,
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right,
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't,
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.

Chorus:
But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,

I never trust a narcissist,
Oh but they love me...,
So I play 'em like a violin,
And I make it look oh-so-easy...,
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three,
This is how the world works,
Now all he thinks about...,
...me....

Pre-Chorus 1:
I can feel the flames on my skin,
Crimson red paint on my lips,
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing,
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming.

Chorus:
They say I did something bad,
Then why's it feel so good?,
They say I did something bad,
But why's it feel so good?,
Most fun I ever had,
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could,
It just felt so good, good.

Verse:
I never trust a playboy, but they love me,
So I fly 'em all around the world,
And I let them think they saved me,
They never see it comin', what I do next,

You gotta leave before you get left,

Summer went away, still, the yearning stays,
I play it cool with the best of them,
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me,
It's okay, we're the best of friends,
Anyway,
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys,
I touch my phone as if it's your face,
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out,
There's just one who could make me stay,
All my days.

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes,
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this,
I hosted parties and starved my body,
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss,
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money,
My friends from home don't know what to say,
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown,
And I saw something they can't take away,
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned,
Everything you lose is a step you take,
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it,
You've got no reason to be afraid,
Chorus:
You're on your own, kid,
Yeah, you can face this,
You're on your own, kid,
You always have been.

These are the song lyrics for song #1271:
Verse 1:
I know I’m probably better off on my own,
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know,
What he had when he had it,
And I see the permanent damage you did to me,
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic,
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror,
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it,
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run.

Chorus:
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again,
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man,
And I know why we had to say goodbye,
Like the back of my hand,
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man,
A better man.

Verse 2:
I know I’m probably better off all alone,
Than needing a man who could change his mind,
At any given minute,
And it was always on your terms,
I waited on every careless word,
Hoping it might turn sweet again,
Like it was in the beginning,
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now,
You’re talking down to me like I'll always be around,
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun,
Oh, you never thought I’d run,

Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?,
What would happen if God never let it snow?,
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?,
Tell me, what would you find?.

Chorus:

Something holy, not superficial,
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives,
It's something we all try to ignore,
And put a wreath up on your door,
So here's something you should know that is for sure,
Christmas must be something more.

Verse 2:
What if angels did not pay attention to,
All the things that we wished they would always do?,
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?,
Then I think there is something we all forgot,
What would happen if presents all went away?,
Tell me, what would you find?.

[Verse 1:
We were both young when I first saw you,
I close my eyes and the flashback starts,
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, Hello,
Little did I know.

Pre-Chorus:
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet,
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, Please don't go,
And I said.

Chorus:
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone,
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run,
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say, Yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you,

Bridge:
But I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around,
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town.

Chorus:
And I said, Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone,
I keep waiting for you, but you never come,
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,

Did you have to do this?,
I was thinking that you could be trusted,
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?,
Now it's all rusted,

Baby, I couldn't breathe,
And rub it in so deep,
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me.

These are the song lyrics for song #1277:
Verse 1:
Do you remember the day,
I leaned up against your car,
And it started rolling down the street?,
You screamed and ran after it,
And tried to open the door,
And it ran over your foot,
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.

Chorus:
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you,
It takes five seconds to need you,
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds,
'Cause they don't know to play our song,
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you,
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me,
'Cause that's where you belong,
Until Brad Pitt comes along.

Verse 2:
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie,
And you said it reminded you of me?,
And I threw the remote at you,
And you said my point exactly,
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me,

Verse 1:
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no,
She didn't have a reason to stay,

She looked at her keys and found a reason to run.

Pre-Chorus:
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound,
But I understand it somehow.

Chorus:
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?,
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies,
And unfamiliar exit signs?,

Verse 2:

But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind,

Song title is : All Too Well (10 Minute Version) The Short Film:  by Taylor Swift:
[Verse 1:
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now.

Verse 2:
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze,
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate,
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

Pre-Chorus:
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh.

Chorus:
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street,
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me,
Wind in my hair, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

Verse 3:
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red,
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me,
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy,
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town,
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, Any time now,
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was,
'Til we were dead and gone and buried,
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same,
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,

And I know it's long gone and,
There was nothing else I could do,
And I forget about you long enough,
To forget why I needed to.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,
Down the stairs, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And there we are again when nobody had to know,
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath,
Sacred prayer and we'd swear,
To remember it all too well, yeah.

Bridge:
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up,
Runnin' scared, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest,
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here,
'Cause I remember it all, all, all,
Verse 4:
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell,
Every time you double-cross my mind,
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine,
And that made me want to die,
The idea you had of me, who was she?,
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you,
Not weepin' in a party bathroom,
Some actress askin' me what happened, you,
That's what happened, you,
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes,
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show,
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come,
And he said, It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one.

Verse 5:
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it,
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it,
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,
You can't get rid of it,
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, you were there,
You remember it all,
Down the stairs, you were there,
You remember it all,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Verse 6:
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes,
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age,
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones,
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight,
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?,
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?,
'Cause in this city's barren cold,
I still remember the first fall of snow,
And how it glistened as it fell,
I remember it all too well.

Outro:
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?,
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?,
Just between us, I remember it all too well (Just between us),
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell,
Every time you double-cross my mind,

Verse 1:
Sometimes I wonder how it's going to feel,
Will my first love be true and real?,
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?,

And my daddy tells me that I light up his world,
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl,
He tried to teach me from the very start,
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart.

Chorus:
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?,
Will it be filled with hope and desire?,
Will my love come in a pouring rain?,
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain,
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love.

Verse 2:
I know I'm not a little girl anymore,
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before,
Sweet sensations and anticipations,
Calling commotion to my emotions,
And I hear the words my daddy said to me,
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free,
And love will find you one way or another,
Be good to yourself and be good to each other,

Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game,

Stumble up the porch step,
You sat down in the car,
Only thirteen blocks across this town,

To make up my mind,
So I best be driving slow,
On my way to letting go.

These headlights they just wanna fade,
Off into the night,
But if they’re half as stubborn as me,
They’ll just keep on shining bright,

The dust does on the dash,
Since the feeling ain’t strong,
I’ll just move on,
And leave this in my past.

हिन्दीCarolina (Video Version) LyricsVerse 1:
Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins,
Lost I was born, lonesome I came,
Lonesome I'll always stay,
Carolina knows why for years I roam,
Free as these birds, light as whispers,
Carolina knows.

Pre-Chorus:
And you didn't see me here,
No, they never did see me here,
And she's in my dreams.

Chorus:
Into the mist, into the clouds,
Don't leave,
I make a fist, I make it count,
And there are places I will never, ever go,
And things that only Carolina will ever know.

Verse 2:
Carolina stains on the dress she left,
Indeliblе scars, pivotal marks,
Blue as the life shе fled,
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?,
Hide me like robes, down the back road,
Muddy these webs we weave,

And you didn't see me here (Mhm),
They never saw me.

Verse 3:
Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said,
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed,
But the sleep comes fast, and I'll meet no ghosts,
It's between me, the sand, and the sea,
Carolina knows.

Verse 1:
It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday,
But now who are you?,
I thought I knew,
Your eyes happen now to look right through me,
It’s like you forgot the words you whispered to me,
They weren't true,
It's like it wasn't you.

Chorus:
Could you tell me what did I do?,
Because it can't be we're already through,
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?,
Was that just what you do?,
What did you need from me?,
Tell me.

Verse 2:
Take time to realize,
I know that people change their minds,
But that was something I wished you would say to my face,
But you ran away.

Verse 1:
I heard a song tonight on the radio,
Another girl sings about a boy,
Just sees his face in every space in every room,
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there,
If I close my eyes will you be there?.

Chorus:
I don't want to lose your face,
And I don't want to wake one day,
And not remember what time erased,
And I don't want to turn around,
Because I’m not scared,
Of what love gave me and took away,
And I don't want to lose your face.

Verse 2:
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom,
And I hope it never falls,
And I hope I never lose that feeling,
I used to get when you would call,
And now I wonder to myself,
Who were you and where are you?,
Were you ever here at all?.

Verse 1:
We were both young when I first saw you,
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts,
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, Hello,
Little did I know.

Pre-Chorus:
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet,
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, Please, don't go, and I said.

Chorus:
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone,
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run,
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say Yes.

Song title is : I Forgot That You Existed (Piano/Vocal) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1299:
Spoken Intro:
So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session. I was writing with two writers I hadn't ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called I Forgot That You Existed, and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started.

Sung:
I forgot that you existed,
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't,
And it was so nice.

(Humming),
I forgot that you existed,
I forgot that you existed,
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't,
And it was so nice.

I forgot that you existed,
How I'd miss you but I didn't,
And it was so nice,
So peaceful and.

How many nights I, how you did me,
How many days did I wait thinking,
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?,
(Humming).

Looks good without any makeup on,
Green eyes kind of thing,

She's spontaneous, she ain't afraid of anything,
She’s not the jealous type,
She's the type you give a diamond ring.

Pre-Chorus:
And I came along, just after she walked out,
Picking up the pieces 'til I've figured out.

Chorus:
There's a girl that you want,
She's everything that I am not,
And you can't stop thinking about her,
There's a thin little line,
And it’s like you cross it every time,
When you can’t stop thinking about her.

Verse 2:
She came from a really small town,
She liked to watch football with you,
Well, I'd learn football too, if you wanted me to,

Song title is : Closest to a Cowboy by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1301:
Verse 1:
I drive around this town,
In a Mustang with the top down,
And six running horses under my hood,
Well that’s good enough for me,
Don’t need the real thing,
That’s just another thing,
For me to try to tame,
Don’t know if I could,
It might just break me,
I thought there for a little while,
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him.

Chorus:
Snap buttons on a denim shirt,
Blue jeans and a little dirt,
That’s the closest you’ll see me,
Feet hanging out a pickup truck,
Crazy and a little rough,
Running free,
That’s the closest to a cowboy,
You’ll see me.

Verse 2:
Before I met him,
I was so sane and grounded,
Before he taught me how to lie,
And crawl out the window,
I learned the dirt roads,
And I got my heart broken,
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry,
And how to let go,
I thought there for a little while,
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him,

I can't believe you did it again,
Walked by and took my heart with you,

Trying to have a dream without you in it,
But how can I put out this fire,
When you're the one who lit it.

Song title is : Who I’ve Always Been by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1304:
Verse 1:
You walk in here with your guitar man,
Your shiny boots and your full-on band,
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand,
Singing songs you've got memorized,
With whatever talent money buys,
So polished that it slips right through your hands.

Pre-Chorus 1:
But don't worry yourself, I ain’t your competition,
Don't flatter yourself, that was never my intention.

Chorus:
I want to talk about what you are that I ain’t,
Let's talk about what you do that I can't,
Let's talk about me and you,
And that empty room and who wins,
Let's talk about what you did to get here,
Let's talk about blood, and sweat, and tears,
Let's talk about what you want to be,
And who I've always been.

Verse 2:
I walk in here with a beat-up case,
The same guitar I've always played,
And the words I wrote down on a page,
When I was 12 years old and small town raised,
You tell the crowd you're paying dues,
I tell them, This is what I do,
And it’s what I put my life into,
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume,

And what do you do that I can't?,

And you'd be standin' in my front porch light,
And I knew you'd come back to me,
You'd come back to me,
And you'd come back to me,
And you'd come back.

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone,
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run,
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'.

Bridge 1: Love Story:
Oh, oh,
I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around,
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town, I said,
Breakdown: Love Story:
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone,
I keep waiting for you but you never come,
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said.

Chorus 3: Love Story:
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone,
I love you and that's all I really know,
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress,
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'.

Bridge 2: You Belong With Me:
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night,
I'm the one who makes you laugh,
When you know you're about to cry,
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams,
I think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Chorus 4: You Belong With Me:
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?,
Been here all along so why can't you see?,
You belong with me, yeah,
Let me see you jump!,
Standing by and waiting at your back door,
All this time, how could you not know, baby?,
You belong with me,
Outro: You Belong With Me:
You belong with me,
Have you ever thought just maybe,
You belong with me?,

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst,

I said, Remember this moment in the back of my mind,
The time we stood with our shaking hands,
The crowds in the stands went wild,
We were the kngs and the queens,
And they read off our names,
The night we danced like we knew our lives,
Would never be the same,

On a history book page,
It was the end of a decade,
But the start of an age,

I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,
I was screaming, Long live that look on your face,
And bring on all the pretenders,
One day, we will be remembered.

Verse 1:
Once I thought that love was something I could never do,

But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you,
Is more than a reaction to your touch,
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough.

Chorus:
The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me,
The way you kiss, The way you cry,

There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you),
That don't do something for me.

Whoa.

Verse 2:

And baby it's no mystery why I surrender,

She had one little promise she was going to keep.

Song title is : The Future of Music Is a Love Story by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1329:
-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us.

There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past.

However, some artists will be like finding the one. We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon.

I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say shock; I said surprise. I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?.

In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be.

There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento kids these days want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be how many followers you have on Instagram.,
Fan Power,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likeA friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around.

Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool.

This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all.

Celebrity Spotlight.

I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, It was never this crazy for us back then! And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to.

And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism.

And I'd also like a nice garden.

Verse 1:
Here we go again,
I kinda wanna be more than friends,
So take it easy on me,
I'm afraid you're never satisfied,

We're sick like animals,
We play pretend,
So take it easy,
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive,
No, I won't sleep tonight.

Oh, oh,
I want some more,

Verse 1:
You and I walk a fragile line,
I have known it all this time,
But I never thought I'd live to see it break,
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet,
And I can't trust anything now,
It's coming over you like it's all a big mistake.

Pre-Chorus:
Oh-Whoa, holding my breath,
Won't lose you again,
Something's made your eyes go cold.

Chorus:
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this,
I thought I had you figured out,
Something's gone terribly wrong,
You're all I wanted,
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this,
I thought I had you figured out,
Can't breathe whenever you're gone,
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted.

Verse 2:
Stood there and watched you walk away,
From everything we had,

Song title is : Lover (Piano/Vocal) by Taylor Swift:
 Writing the song Lover,
These are the song lyrics for song #1334:
Spoken:
Writing the song Lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record,
So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into,
And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano,
And this is what happened.

So it is, it's basically, I don't see it as a piano. I think it's that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so.

Sung: Verse 1:
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January,
This is our place, we make the rules,
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear,
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?.

Sung: Chorus:
Can I go where you go?,
Can we always be this close forever and ever?,
And ah, take me out, take me home,
You're my, my, my, my lover.

Spoken:
Yeah, I love the walk down,
I love the walk down,
I was trying to figure out what the hell is gonna happen there,
So the, so,

Sung: Verse 2:
We could let our friends crash on the couches,
This is our place, we make the call,
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you,
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all.

Sung: Chorus:
Can I go where you go?,
Can we always be this close forever and ever?,
And ah, take me out, and take me home,
You're my, my, my, my lover.

Spoken:
Okay and then I have this bridge thing that's um, essentially,
Well, no I was,
I did, I did it in this key,
But it could be like a thing where's like a key change,
So it plays off of the walk down-ish,
But it's, this is the melody of it, it goes, it's like.

Sung: Bridge:
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?,
With every guitar string scar on my hands,
I take this magnetic force-,
Oh, fuck,
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover,
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue,
All's well that ends well to end up with you,
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover,
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me,
Spoken:
Wait so goes like.

Sung: Bridge:
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me,
And at every table, I'll save you a seat.

Spoken:
So goes, and you, it goes.

Sung: Bridge:
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me,

All's well that ends well to end up with you,

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me,
And at every table, I'll save you a seat.

Spoken:
You like? Yeah! I've never, I never do these cords, but, I was really at the piano, like, hashing it out yesterday.

Song title is : I Wished on a Plane by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1335:
Verse 1:
Throwing pennies at the fountain,
When you're standing on a mountain,
It's kind of hard to aim,
Like the tree we carved our names in,
There must be an explanation,
Guess it didn't get enough rain,
I need reasons why you're leaving.

Chorus:
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star,
I guess what you wrote on paper,
Wasn't written on your heart,
Could've sworn you said you loved me,
I guess I heard you wrong,
And I guess I wished on a plane,
That I thought was a star.

Verse 2:
Diving off into the deep end,
Honestly believed you'd be there,
When I jumped in,
Guess it ain't your territory,
We had the perfect love story,
Except the ending,
Nothing comes true,
When it comes to you, oh,

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife,

Lost in your current like a priceless wine.

Wherever you stray, I follow,

Wreck my plans, that's my man.

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (wind),
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in,
As if you were a mythical thing,

cardigan / august / willow (Grammys 2021) LyricsVerse 1: Cardigan:
Vintage tee, brand new phone,
High heels on cobblestones,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing,
Sequin smile, black lipstick,
Sensual politics,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing.

Chorus 1: Cardigan:
'Cause I knew you,
Steppin' on the last train,
Marked me like a bloodstain, I,
I knew you,
Tried to change the ending,
Peter losing Wendy, I,
I knew you,
Leavin' like a father,
Running like water, I,
'Cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing.

Verse 2: Cardigan:
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss,
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-if's,
The smell of smoke would hang around this long,
'Cause I knew everything when I was young,
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time,
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line,
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired,
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light,
And I knew you'd come back to me,
You'd come back to me,
And you'd come back to me,
And you'd come back,

I never needed anything more,
Whispers of Are you sure?,

Chorus 2: August:
But I can see us lost in the memory,
August slipped away into a moment in time,
'Cause it was never mine,
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets,
August sipped away like a bottle of wine,
'Cause you were never mine.

Bridge: August & Willow:
Back when we were still changing for the better,
Wanting was enough,
For me, it was enough,
To live for the hope of it all,
Cancel plans just in case you'd call,
And say, Meet me behind the mall,
So much for summer love and saying us,
'Cause you weren't mine to lose,
You weren't mine to lose,

They count me out time and time again,
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,

We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me,
You were the perfect view of misery.

Intro:
I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely barging in,
On a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marrying the wrong girl.

Verse 1:
I sneak in and see your friends,
And her snotty little family,
All dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry.

Pre-Chorus:
This is surely not,
What you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say.

Chorus:
Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said speak now,

By your lovely bride-to-be.

She floats down the aisle,
Like a pageant queen,
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me (Don't you?).

Interlude:
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh,
Ooh, ooh,
(Say a single vow).

Bridge:
I hear the preacher say,
Speak now or forever hold your peace,
There's the silence, there's my last chance,
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me,
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only looking at you.

Verse 3:
I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely barging in,
On a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,

Verse 1:
It would've been nice to see you coming,
But that would've ruined the surprise,
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world,
But then the truth would hurt my eyes,
It would've been good for you to be there,
And every time you always would,
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time,
And nothing seems to be a blur.

Chorus:
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground,
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down,
But you were always there when I needed,
You would always see me clearly,
And you were never looking for a thank you,
I'm saying one for you.

Verse 2:
Would've been cool to never fall down,
But then I never would've seen,
The power isn't with the picture perfect person,
You told me better things to come from in between.

And I could have spent a life with you,
But those days are over,
You were calling my name,
When your face faded from view.

Pre-Chorus:
Wasn't it you that told me?,
The sun would always chase the day,
Wasn't it you that told me?.

Chorus:
Angels fly, in the air tonight,
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?,
Stars collide in the air so light,
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night.

Verse 2:
Oh,

It was awesome. Uh, except for, I didn't know if I should, I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old?.

Radio DJ:
Ah, ha ha ha.

Tim McGraw:
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more, I don't know if its true or not, but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old, I don't know if that's true, but that's what I choose to think..

Radio DJ:
Why don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment, or uh, he's old?.

Taylor Swift:
Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah. (Laughing).

I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great..

Taylor Swift:
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for, uh, having good... music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker (Laughing).

Radio DJ:
Well-.

Taylor Swift:
The funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer, some of the songs that you write like four hours, you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes. And ya know, I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But, um, my label heard it and was like, we're putting that out.(Laughing).

Tim McGraw:
Well, I'm glad ya did, 'cause, um, it's doing well for ya.,
Radio DJ:
So I-, so I understand that you two guys have not talked..

Tim McGraw:
No..

Radio DJ:
You haven't met..

Tim McGraw:
No..

Taylor Swift:
No, we've never talked or met or anything..

Tim McGraw:
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly,
Or something like that. Oh, I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message, so, I don't know if she got it or not..

Taylor Swift:
Oh my God. They never gave that to me..

Tim McGraw:
They didn't? Okay, well, there ya go. I did. (Laughing).

Radio DJ:
So I-I.,
Taylor Swift:
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything..

Tim McGraw:
Not at all..

Radio DJ:
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?.

Taylor Swift:
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know, I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking, ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad..

Tim McGraw:
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad,
I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-.

Taylor Swift:
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?.

Tim McGraw:
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way..

Taylor Swift:
Oh my gosh, she's awesome..

Tim McGraw:
I agree..

Radio DJ:
This, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um, did this, did this really happen?.

Taylor Swift:
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing,
Session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw,
Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um... (Laughing).,
I actually this this is kinda strange, but I actually came up with the,
melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year,
of high school..

Tim McGraw:
Now I feel old..

Taylor Swift:
And um, I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself. And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know? That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are..

Tim McGraw:
Aww, thank you..

Taylor Swift:
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first. And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano. And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes, Well, that's your first single. (Laughing).

Taylor Swift:
And I'm like, well..

Tim McGraw:
Well, you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor (Laughing).

Taylor Swift:
That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month..

Tim McGraw:
Alright, great (Laughing).

Tim McGraw:
Well, congratulations 'cause it's your first single. First top ten hit and thats pretty exciting. And I know you're off to the races here.,
You're just doing great and, uh, congratulations, very exciting for you!.

Taylor Swift:
Awesome, its been so exciting, Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?.

Tim McGraw:

Taylor Swift:
Well, I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it..

Tim McGraw:

Taylor Swift:

willow (90's trend remix) LyricsVerse 1:
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife,
And if it was an open-shut case,
I never would've known from that look on your face,
Lost in your current like a priceless wine.

Chorus:
The more that you say, the less I know,
Wherever you stray, I follow,
I'm begging for you to take my hand,
Wreck my plans, that's my man,
That's my man.

Verse 2:
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in,
As if you were a mythical thing,
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win.

Chorus:
The more that you say, the less I know,
Wherever you stray, I follow,
I'm begging for you to take my hand,
Wreck my plans, that's my man,
You know that my train could take you home,
Anywhere else is hollow,
I'm begging for you to take my hand,
Wreck my plans, that's my man,
That's my man,

Verse 3:
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark,
Show me the places where the others gave you scars,
Now this is an open-shut case,
I guess I should've known from the look on your face,
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art.

Chorus:
The more that you say, the less I know,
Wherever you stray, I follow,
I'm begging for you to take my hand,

my tears ricochet (the long pond studio sessions) LyricsVerse 1:
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room,
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too,
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe,
All the hell you gave me?,
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you,
'Til my dying day.

Chorus:
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace,
And you're the hero flying around, saving face,
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?,
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed,
Look at how my tears ricochet.

Verse 2:
We gather stones, nevеr knowing what they'll mean,
Some to throw, somе to make a diamond ring,
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you,
But what a ghostly scene,
You wear the same jewels that I gave you,
As you bury me.

Chorus:
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace,
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave,
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?,
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed,

And when you can't sleep at night,
You hear my stolen lullabies.

Chorus:
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace,
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves,
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same,
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed,
You turned into your worst fears,
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain,
Crossin' out the good years,
And you're cursing my name, wishin' I stayed,
Look at how my tears ricochet.

It was so nice throwing big parties,
Jump into the pool from the balcony,
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea,
And there are no rules when you show up here,
Bass beat rattling the chandelier,
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year.

Pre-Chorus 1: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things:
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?,
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates.

Chorus 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things:
This is why we can't have nice things, darling,
Because you break them,
I had to take them away,

Verse 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things:
It was so nice being friends again,
There I was, giving you a second chance,
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand,
And therein lies the issue,
Friends don't try to trick you,
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you,
And so I took an axe to a mended fence,

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately,
If only you weren't so shady.

They don't care about the he-said-she-said,

Had to listen to all this drama,
And here's to you,
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face.

Chorus 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things:

Was that blood or a wine stain,
On your wedding dress,

These are the song lyrics for song #1356:
Verse 1:
Isn't it funny how many times we can say,
We've drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page,
And moved on,
That's what we thought,
But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed thought,
Uh oh, uh oh.

Pre-Chorus:
I won't tell nobody,
I won't tell my friends,
We'll just drive down this road 'til the one we're on ends,
And we'll tell each other things like I need you.

Chorus:
You and me,
Baby this is what we do,
I finally see,
There are people you just come back to,
So fall back on me,
I'll fall back on you.

We always let someone come in between,
Talk around the truth and never say what we mean,

These are the song lyrics for song #1358:
Verse 1:
Like one of those fireflies,
Oh, it looks so good till it's in your hand,
It's like one of those memories,
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand,
It's like one of those crazy dreams,
And the permanent screens in the magazines,
Saying, Why'd I love?,
All it does is break your heart.

Chorus:
One morning does it all add up?,
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?,
You're getting close to giving up,
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time,
Love or lie, live or die,
I, well, I guess that's life.

Verse 2:
Like one of those people,
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face,
It's like one of those stories,
Where the hero dies in the very last race,
Like one of those endless cries,
And the crazy lies of a hurting child,
Saying, Why did love have to hurt?,
It broke my heart,

Given one chance,
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said yes.

cardigan (the long pond studio sessions) LyricsVerse 1:
Vintage tee, brand new phone,
High heels on cobblestones,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing,
Sequin smile, black lipstick,
Sensual politics,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing.

Chorus:
But I knew you,
Dancin' in your Levi's,
Drunk under a streetlight, I,
I knew you,
Hand under my sweatshirt,
Baby, kiss it better, I.

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorite.

Running like water, I,
'Cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing,

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss,
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs,
The smell of smoke would hang around this long,
'Cause I knew everything when I was young,
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time,
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line,
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired,
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light,
And I knew you'd come back to me,
You'd come back to me,
And you'd come back to me,
And you'd come back.

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorit.

These are the song lyrics for song #1371:
Verse 1:
We were in the backseat,
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar,
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car,
We were a fresh page on the desk,
Filling in the blanks  as  we  go,
As if the  street lights pointed  in an arrow head,
Leading us home.

Chorus:
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends,
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend,
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name,
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away,
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again.

Verse 2:
Windows flung right open, autumn air,
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours,
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street,
Memorize the creaks in the floor,
Back when we were card sharks, playing games,
I thought you were leading me on,
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street,
Before you even knew I was gone,

These are the song lyrics for song #1372:
Verse 1:
You said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,
I said, that's a lie,
Just a boy in a pickup truck,
That had a funny way of getting stuck,
On backroads at night.

Pre-Chorus:
I was right there beside you all summer long,
Then in time we woke up to find that summer gone.

Chorus:
When you think Tim McGraw,
Hope you think my favorite song,
The one we danced to all night long,
The moon like a spotlight on the lake,
When you think happiness,
I hope you think that little black dress,
The one you said you liked best,
Next to my old faded pair of jeans,
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think me.

Verse 2:
September saw a month of tears,
Thanking God that you weren't here,
To see me like that,
In a box beneath my bed,
Sits a letter that you never read,
From three summers back,

The one you said you liked best,
Next to my old faded pair of jeans,
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think me.

Bridge:
Been back a couple times since then,
And I didn't look you up,
But some trains you can't catch again,
You gotta leave it as it was.

Chorus:
But when you think Tim McGraw,
Hope you think my favorite song,
The one we danced to all night long,
The moon like a spotlight on the lake,
When you think happiness,
I hope you think that little black dress,
The one you said you liked best,
Next to my old faded pair of jeans,
When you think Tim McGraw,
When you think Tim McGraw,
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think me,
Outro:
You said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,
I said, that's a lie.

Song title is : Never Fade by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1373:
Verse 1:
I think you fell off of your cloud today,
You didn't see it coming or did you,
You tried to please everybody,
But the sweet breeze swept you away.

Pre-Chorus:
The sun goes down on a good day,
Tomorrow is still an unknown,
You think you're all alone in this place,
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby.

Chorus:
Oh don't fade away baby,
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do,
Don't count the days as they leave you,
Count them as you find a day new,
Don't fade away,
Never fade.

Verse 2:
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you,
Somebody blows your candle out,
You wore a mask, now that's broken too,
Everybody else was everything to you,

Spoken Intro:
There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?,
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I’m such a fan of and,
I’d love to play you  some music I’m a fan of that’s come from LA, is that okay?,
This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song, it’s called “Bette Davis Eyes”.

Verse 1:
Her hair is Harlow gold,
Her lips sweet surprise,
Her hands are never cold,
She's got Bette Davis eyes.

She'll turn her music on,
You won't have to think twice,
She's pure as New York snow,
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes.

Chorus 1:
And she'll tease you,
She'll unease you,
All the better just to please you,
She's precocious and she knows just,
What it takes to make a pro blush,
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs,
She's got Bette Davis eyes,
Verse 2:
She'll let you take her home,
It whets her appetite,
She'll lay you on her throne,
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes.


Chorus 2:
She'll expose you,
And just knows you,
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you,
She's ferocious and she knows just,
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy,ayy),
All the boys think she's a spy,
She's got Bette Davis eyesSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also lik.

You make the sweetest sight at the window,
If you had never come out of the blue,

Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself,

With a cat named Eloise,

These are the song lyrics for song #1380:
Verse 1:
Here in my mind the sky looks the same,
On every day you loved me,
When we started home it started to rain,
You put your coat around me,
We stood there in the road,
You held me so close,
But did you ever let go.

Chorus:
Down came the rain,
Lightning and thunder,
We tried in vain,
To hold on to each other,
Winds of change blew you away from me,
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin,
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been,
Just when our love was like a burning flame,
Down came the rain.

Verse 2:
In through the window I see her with you,
I’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry,
I guess the storm is over for you,
But look at the tears here in my eyes,
I just stood there like a ghost,
As you held her so close,
And as I let you go,

Song title is : How To Save A Life by Taylor Swift:
 Step one, you say, We need to talk.,
These are the song lyrics for song #1381:
Verse 1:
Step one, you say, We need to talk.,
He walks, you say, Sit down. It's just a talk.,
He smiles politely back at you,
You stare politely right on through,
Some sort of window to your right,
As he goes left and you stay right,
Between the lines of fear and blame,
You begin to wonder why you came.

Chorus:
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend,
Somewhere along in the bitterness,
And I would have stayed up with you all night,
Had I known how to save a life.

Verse 2:
Let him know that you know best,
'Cause after all you do know best,
Try to slip past his defense,
Without granting innocence,
Lay down a list of what is wrong,
The things you've told him all along,
Pray to God, he hears you,
And I pray to God, he hears you,
Chorus:
And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend,
Somewhere along in the bitterness,
And I would have stayed up with you all night,
Had I known how to save a life.

Verse 3:
As he begins to raise his voice,
You lower yours and grant him one last choice,
Drive until you lose the road,
Or break with the ones you've followed,
He will do one of two things,
He will admit to everything,
Or he'll say he's just not the same,
And you'll begin to wonder why you came.

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend,

Verse 1:
Walking downtown shuffling my feet,
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete,
Store windows, traveled for miles,
But something I passed really caught my eye,
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars,
But I fell in love with this here guitar.

Chorus:
Nice to meet you, can I teach you,
All I know, can you show me what you do,
Where have you been,
What have you seen,
Who were you before you even knew me,
Have you been played for endless hours,
Or were you left in the corner,
Or were you someone's best friend,
This here guitar.

Verse 2:
It was my baby, anyone could see,
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty,
But I can't help wondering why,
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye,
The cracks down the middle,
Can't see where they are,

Gonna look at you like that, I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that.

(Verse 2),
Won't you say, that we can still be friends,
It doesn't work that way,
And don't you dare think, that a pack of all my tears can take that,
Crying out when I'm alone.

(Pre-Chorus),
Doing right here, I'm crying right now, you can watch me crumble down, that’s for breaking my heart, so baby don’t stop, thinking you could ask me not to look at you like, that.

(Chorus),
Gonna look at you like that, I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it’s the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that,

'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that, gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, after what you put me through, I'm gonna have to let you know,???: .

Song title is : Last Kiss (Live/2011) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1388:
Verse 1:
I still remember the look on your face,
Lit through the darkness at 1:58,
The words that you whispered for just us to know,
You told me you loved me,
So why did you go away?,
Away.

Verse 2:
I do recall now,  the  smell  of the rain,
Fresh  on the pavement,
I  ran off the plane,
That July ninth,
The beat of your heart,
It jumps through your shirt,
I can still feel your arms.

Pre-Chorus:
But now I'll go,
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes,
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss.

Chorus:
I never thought we'd have a last kiss,
I never imagined we'd end like this,
Your name, forever the name on my lips,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likeVerse 3:
I still remember the swing of your step,
The life of the party, you're showing off again,
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in,
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did,
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father,
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets,
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something,
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions.

Pre-Chorus:
And I'll go,
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes,
All that I know is I don't know,
How to be something you miss.

Chorus:
I never thought we'd have a last kiss,
I never imagined we'd end like this,
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh.

Bridge:
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep,
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe,
And I'll keep up with our old friends,
Just to ask them how you are,
Hope it's nice where you are,
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day,
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed,
You can plan for a change in weather and time,
But I never planned on you changing your mind,
Pre-Chorus:
So, I'll go,
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes,
All that I know is I don't know,
How to be something you miss.

Chorus:
I never thought we'd have a last kiss,
I never imagined we'd end like this,
Your name, forever the name on my lips.

Outro:
Just like our last kiss,
Forever the name on my lips,
Just like our last.

willow (moonlit witch version) LyricsVerse 1:
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife,
And if it was an open-shut case,
I never would've known from that look on your face,
Lost in your current like a priceless wine.

Chorus:

Wherever you stray, I follow,
I'm begging for you to take my hand,
Wreck my plans, that's my man.

Verse 2:
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in,
As if you were a mythical thing,
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,
And there was onе prize I'd cheat to win.

Song title is : Daylight (Live from Paris) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1392:
Verse 1:
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in,
Everyone looked worse in the light,
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven,
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye.

Chorus:
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you,
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night,
But now I see daylight,
I only see daylight.

Verse 2:
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky,
So I became the butt of the joke,
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked,
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke,
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down,
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town,
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now,
It's brighter now, now.

Chorus:
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,
(I can never look away),
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you,
(Things I'm never gonna say),
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night,
(Now I'm wide awake),
But now I see daylight,
I only see daylight,

You know the greatest films of all time were never made.

And if you wanted me, you really should've showed,
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow,
And it's alright now.

Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool,

Song title is : Billboard Woman of the Decade Speech by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1397:
Jameela Jamil presents Swift with her award.: .

Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a... it's not a short speech, so, just, I don't want this to slip and break, 'cause it's very important to me..

Jamil takes the award from Swift to hold.: .

Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor, good evening. I wanna first thank Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for -.

Microphone stand lowers.: .

Whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent, okay. I wanna say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their Woman of the Decade. So, what does it mean to be the Woman of this Decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16. And then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless, and I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs Love Story and You Belong With Me to number one for the first time..

And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there. Whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success. Or whether it was a savvy record label; it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did..

Audience claps.: .

Huh, I'll take it, thanks! Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems, and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award, with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young, new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room..

At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was A Swift Backlash, which is clever, you gotta give it to them. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then..

So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics..

They're saying I'm dating too much in my twenties? Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single... for years. Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs? Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, okay, here's an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989..

Audience cheers.:
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165Oh, you heard it? Sick! Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that, too. Now I'm actually a calculated, manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman? Okay, I'll disappear from public view... for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you? Okay, here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere..

In the last ten years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized, and measured up to each other, and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or, have you ever heard someone say, about a male artist, I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is, there's just something about him I don't like. No! That criticism is reserved for us. But, you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthly criticized -.

Someone in the audience cheers.: .

Yes! Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music. And this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward, is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us..

And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalía, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now..

Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios, behind the mixing board, in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room..

Audience cheers.: .

We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand-in-hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators, and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you?.

Audience claps.: .

Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate. As if it's an app, or a shoe line. This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings in a deal that I'm told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group..

Yet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art. The music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced..

I'm fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, But he's always been nice to me! when I'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. And of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs. The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could buy me, but I'm obviously not going willingly..

Yet, the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times, and I will never, ever forget it. Like, ever.,
Audience laughs.: .

But to conclude, I will say that in ten years, I've seen forward steps in our industry. In our awareness, our inclusion, our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct. I've seen the advent of social media, the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists. And I've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before. I've leaned on that support, and it has kept me in a place where, no matter what, I always wanted to keep making music for them..

I was up on a stage in New York City in 2014, accepting Billboard Woman of the Year, and I was talking about the future of streaming. How we needed to make sure that the female artists, writers, and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly. This was before my record deal with Universal, last year, that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their Spotify shares, unrecupable. So, thank you for that..

Audience cheers.: .

This speech I'm referring to was on my 25th birthday. I'm about to turn thirty tonight, woo! But my exact quote during this speech was, I really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians. Because somewhere, right now, your future Woman of the Year is probably sitting in a piano lesson, or in a girls' choir. And today, right now, we need to take care of her. I've since learned that, at that exact moment, an 11-year old girl in California really was taking piano lessons, and really was in a girls' choir. And this year, she has been named Woman of the Year at the age of seventeen. Her name is Billie..

Audience cheers.: .

And those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry. The ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people. The ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier, makes their night more fun, makes their love feel more sacred, or their heartache feel less isolating. The ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love: music. And no matter what else enters the conversation, we will bring it back to music..

And as for me, lately I've been focusing less on doing what they say I can't do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade. I'm honored to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much..

Song title is : Reputation Tour Book Intro by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1399:
he said/she said. Here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us, the things we're insecure about, and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks, and confetti..

To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you..

Here's to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party.,
Here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes. Here's to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything I've learned about a reputation and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, I've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums.,
Thanks to you, I'm doing better than I ever was..

Love,,

These are the song lyrics for song #1400:
betty (Live from the 2020 Academy of Country Music Awards) LyricsVerse 1:
Betty, I won't make assumptions,
About why you switched your homeroom, but,
I think it's 'cause of me,
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard,
When I passed your house,
It's like I couldn't breathe.

Pre-Chorus:
You heard the rumors from Inez,
You can't believe a word she says,
Most times, but this time it was true,
The worst thing that I ever did,
Was what I did to you.

Chorus:
But if I just showed up at your party,
Would you have me? Would you want me?,
Would you tell me to go straight to hell,
Or lead me to the garden?,
In the garden, would you trust mе,
If I told you it was just a summer thing?,
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything,
But I know I miss you.

Verse 2:
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong,
Your favorite song was playing,
From the far side of the gym,
I was nowhere to be found,
I hate the crowds, you know that,
Plus, I saw you dance with him,

Bridge:
I was walking home on broken cobblestones,
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like,
A figment of my worst intentions,
She said James, get in, let's drive,
Those days turned into nights,
Slept next to her, but,
I dreamt of you all summer long,
Verse 3:
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep,
And I planned it out for weeks now,
But it's finally sinkin' in,
Betty, right now is the last time,
I can dream about what happens when,
You see my face again.

Pre-Chorus:
The only thing I wanna do,
Is make it up to you,
So I showed up at your party,
Yeah, I showed up at your party.

Chorus:
Yeah, I showed up at your party,
Will you have me? Will you love me?,
Will you kiss me on the porch,
In front of all your stupid friends?,
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?,
Will it patch your broken wings?,
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything,
But I know I miss you.

Outro:
Standing in your cardigan,
Kissin' in my car again,
Stopped at a streetlight,
You know I miss you.

These are the song lyrics for song #1401:
Verse 1:
You are somebody that I don't know,
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón,
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM,
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out,
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out,
And I'm just like, Hey, are you okay?.

Pre-Chorus:
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression,
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun,
And snakes and stones never broke my bones.

Chorus:
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
You need to calm down, you're being too loud,
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh),
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?,
You need to calm down.

Verse 2:
You are somebody that we don't know,
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile,
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD),
Sunshine on the street at the parade,
But you would rather be in the dark ages,
Makin' that sign must've taken all night,

We all know now we all got crowns,
You need to calm down.

Verse 1: You're Not Sorry:
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around,
I've been giving out chances every time,
And all you do is let me down,
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out,
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
But not this time around.

Chorus: You're Not Sorry:
You don't have to call anymore,
I won't pick up the phone,
This is the last straw,
Don't wanna hurt anymore,
And you can tell me that you're sorry,
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before,
You're not sorry, no, no.

Verse 2: You're Not Sorry:
You're looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know,
Could've loved you all my life if you didn't leave me waiting in the cold,
You've got your share of secrets,
And I'm tired of being last to know,
And now you're asking me to listen,
'Cause it's worked each time before,

You had me crawling for you, honey,
And it never would've gone away, no,
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade.

Pre-Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around:
Don't wanna think about it,
Don't wanna talk about it,
I'm just so sick about it,
Can't believe it's ending this way,
I'm so confused about it,
Feeling the blues about it,
I just can't do without ya,
Won't you tell me, is this fair?.

Is this the way it's really going down?,
Is this how we say goodbye?,
Should've known better when you came around,
That you were gonna make me cry,
It's breaking my heart to watch you go around,
'Cause I know that you're living a lie,
But that's okay, baby,
'Cause in time you will find,

A tale as old as time,
Boy, you got what you deserv.

Song title is : The Man (Live From Paris) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1403:
Verse 1:
I would be complex, I would be cool,
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to,
And that would be okay for me to do,
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you.

Pre-Chorus:
I'd be a fearless leader,
I'd be an alpha type,
When everyone believes ya,
What's that like?.

Chorus:
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can,
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man,
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again,
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man,
I'd be the man,
I'd be the man.

Verse 2:
They'd say I hustled, put in the work,
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve,
What I was wearing, or if I was rude,
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves,

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars,
And getting bitches and models?,
And it's all good if you're bad,
It's okay if you're mad,

They'd paint me out to be bad,
So, it's okay that I'm mad.

These are the song lyrics for song #1404:
Stay Stay Stay:
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night,
I threw my phone across the room, at you,
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
But you stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it,
'Cause I've read you should never leave a fight unresolved,
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet,
And said okay, let's talk,
And I said.

Stay, stay, stay,
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time,
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad,
So I think that it's best if we both stay.

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Who took all of their problems out on me,
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing,
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to.

Stay, stay, stay,
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time,
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad,
So I think that it's best if we both stay,
Stay, stay, stay,
You took the time to memorize me,
My fears, my hopes, and dreams,
I just like hanging out with you all the time,
All those times that you didn't leave,
It's been occurring to me,
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.

Ho Hey:
Ho, hey, ho, hey,
So show your family,
All the blood that I would bleed,
I don't know where I belong,
I don't know where I went wrong,
But I can write a song.

I belong with you,
You belong with me,
You're my sweetheart,
I belong with you,
You belong with me,
You're my sweetheart,
I belong with you,
You belong with me,
You're my sweetheart,
I belong with you,
You belong with me,

this is me trying (the long pond studio sessions) LyricsVerse 1:
I've been having a hard time adjusting,
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting,
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back,
I have a lot of regrets about that,
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout,
Could've followed my fears all the way down,
And maybe I don't quite know what to say,
But I'm here in your doorway.

Chorus:
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying.

Verse 2:
They told me all of my cages were mental,
So I got wasted like all my potential,
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad,
I have a lot of regrets about that,
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere,
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here,
Pouring out my heart to a stranger,
But I didn't pour the whiskey.

Chorus:
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,

And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound,
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you,
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town.

And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying.

Verse 1: Paula Fernandes:
Lembrei desse sentimento,
Gritando dentro de nós,

Vencemos pesadelos enfrentando os dragões,
Criados por nossos medos,
Fruto da imaginação.

I said, Remember this feeling,
I passed the pictures around,

When they gave us our trophies,
And we held them up for our town,

While I bathe in cliffside pools,
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief,

Song title is : Death by a Thousand Cuts (Live from Paris) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1410:
Chorus:
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,
Flashbacks waking me up,
Get drunk, but it's not enough,
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby,
I look through the windows of this love,
Even though we boarded them  up,
Chandelier's  still  flickering here,
'Cause I  can't pretend it's  okay when it's not,
It's death by a thousand cuts.

Verse 1:
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home,
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright,
They say, I don't know,
And what once was ours is no one's now,
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share,
Is this small town,
You said it was a great love, one for the ages,
So  if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?.

Chorus:
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,
Flashbacks waking me up,
Get drunk, but it's not enough,
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby,
I look through the windows of this love,
Even though we boarded them up,
Chandelier's still flickering here,
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,
It's death by a thousand cuts,

My heart, my hips, my body, my love,
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch,
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug,
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club,
Our songs, our films, united we stand,
Our country, guess it was a lawless land,
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand,
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans,
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust,
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up,
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough,
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts.

Chorus:
Get drunk, but it's not enough,
'Cause you're not my baby,
I look through the windows of this love,
Even though we boarded them up,
Chandelier's still flickering here,
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,
No, it's not,
It's death by a thousand cuts.

Post-Chorus:
Part of me that you didn't touch,
My body, my love, my trust,
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no,
Outro:
I take the long way home,
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright,
They say, I don't know.

Song title is : 2022 New York University Commencement Speech by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1411:
еason I'm here is becausе I have a song called 22. And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate New York University's Class of 2022. Not a single one of us here today has done it alone. We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness, or told us the truth, even when it wasn't easy to hear. Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that. Someone read stories to you, and taught you to dream, and offered up some moral code of right and wrong for you to try and live by. Someone tried their best to explain every concept in this insanely complex world to the child that was you as you asked a bazillion questions, like, How does the moon work? and Why can we eat salad, but not grass? And maybe they didn't do it perfectly — no one ever can —, maybe they aren't with us anymore, in that case, I hope you'll remember them today. If they are in this staium, I hope you'll find your own way to express your gratitude for all the steps, and missteps, that have led us to this common destination..

I know that words are supposed to be my thing, but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and dad, and my brother, Austin, for the sacrifices they made every day, so I could go from singing in coffeehouses to standing up here with you today, because no words would ever be enough. To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends, and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now: Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you..

I'd like to thank NYU for making me technically, on paper at least, a doctor. Not the type of doctor you would want around in case of an emergency, unless your specific emergency was that you desperately needed to hear a song with a catchy hook and an intensely cathartic bridge section. Or if your emergency was that you needed a person who can name over 50 breeds of cats in one minute. I never got to have a normal college experience, per se. I went to public high school until 10th grade and then finished my education doing homeschool work on the floors of airport terminals. Then, I went on the road for radio tour, which sounds incredibly glamourous, but in reality, it consisted of a rental car, motels, and my mom and I pretending to have loud mother-daughter fights with each other during boarding, so no one would want the empty seat between us on Southwest..

As a kid, I always thought I would go away to college, imagining the posters I would hang on the wall of my freshman dorm. I even set the ending of my music video for my song Love Story at my fantasy, imaginary college, where I meet a male model reading a book on the grass, and with one single glance, we realize we had been in love in our past lives. Which is exactly what you guys all experienced at some point in the last four years, right?.

But I really can't complain about not having a normal college experience to you, because you went to NYU during a global pandemic, being essentially locked into your dorms and having to do classes over Zoom. Everyone in college during normal times stresses about test scores, but on top of that, you also had to pass, like, a thousand COVID tests. I imagine the idea of a normal college experience was all you wanted, too, but in this case, you and I both learned that you don't always get all the things in the bag that you selected from the menu in the delivery service that is life. You get what you get. And as I would like to say to you, wholeheartedly, you should be very proud of what you've done with it. Today, you leave New York University and then go out into the world, searching what's next. And so will I..

So, as a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice, unless they ask for it. I'll go into this more later. I guess I have been officially solicited in this situation to impart whatever wisdom I might have to tell you things that have helped me so far in my life. Please, bear in mind that I, in no way, feel qualified to tell you what to do. You've worked, and struggled, and sacrificed, and studied, and dreamed your way here today, and so you know what you're doing. You'll do things differently than I did them and for different reasons. So, I won't tell you what to do, 'cause no one likes that. I will, however, give you some life hacks I wish I knew when I was starting out my dreams of a career and navigating life, love, pressure, choices, shame, hope, and friendship..

The first of which is: Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release. What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release. You can't carry all things, all grudges, all updates on your ex, all enviable promotions your school bully got at the hedge fund his uncle started. Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go. Oftentimes, the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so there's more room for them. One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful simple joys. You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning..

Secondly: Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe, retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime, even the term cringe might someday be deemed cringe. I promise you, you're probably doing or wearing something right now that you will look back on later and find revolting and hilarious. You can't avoid it, so don't try to. For example, I had a phase where, for the entirety of 2012, I dressed like a 1950s housewife. But you know what? I was having fun. Trends and phases are fun. Looking back and laughing is fun..

And while we're talking about things that make us squirm, but really shouldn't, I'd like to say I'm a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. It seems to me that there is a false stigma around eagerness in our culture of unbothered ambivalence. This outlook perpetuates the idea that it's not cool to want it; the people who don't try are fundamentally more chic than people who do. And I wouldn't know, because I am a lot of things, but I've never been expert on chic, but I'm the one who's up here, so you have to listen to me when I say this. Never be ashamed of trying. Effortlessness is a myth. The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date, and be friends with in high school. The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company..

I started writing songs when I was 12, and since then, it's been the compass guiding my life, and in turn, my life guided my writing. Everything I do is just an extension of my writing, whether it's directing videos, or a short film, creating the visuals for a tour, or standing on a stage performing. Everything is connected by my love of the craft, the thrill of working through ideas, narrowing them down, polishing it up in the end, editing, waking up in the middle of the night, throwing out an old idea because you thought of a newer, better one, or a plot device that ties it all together. There's a reason they call it a hook: Sometimes a string of words just ensnares me and I can't focus on anything until it's been recorded or written down..

As a songwriter, I've never been able to sit still or stay in one place for too long. I've made and released 11 albums and, in the process, I've switched genre from country to pop to alternative to folk, and this might sound like a very songwriter centric line of discussion, but in a way, I really do think we are all writers. And most of us write in a different voice for different situations. You write differently in your Instagram stories than you do your senior thesis; you send a different type of email to boss than you do to your best friend from home. We are all literary chameleons and I think it's fascinating — it's a continuation of the idea that we are many things all the time. And I know it can be very overwhelming figuring out who to be and when, who you are now and how to act in order to get where you want to go..

I have some good news: It's totally up to you. I have some terrifying news: It's totally up to you.,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165I said to you earlier that I don't ever offer advice unless someone asks for it, and now I'll tell you why. As a person who started my very public career at the age of 15, it came with a price, and that price was years of unsolicited advice. Being the youngest person in every room for over a decade meant that I was constantly being issued warnings from older members of the music industry, media, interviewers, executives. And this advice often presented itself as thinly veiled warnings..

See, I was a teenager at a time when our society was absolutely obsessed with the idea of having perfect young female role models. It felt like every interview I did included slight barbs by the interviewer about me one day running off the rails, and that meant a different thing to every person who said it to me. So, I became a young adult while being fed the message that if I didn't make any mistakes, all the children of America would grow up to be perfect angels. However, if I did slip up, the entire Earth would fall off its axis, and it would be entirely fault, and I would go to pop star jail forever and ever. It was all centered around the idea that mistakes equal failure, and ultimately the loss of any chance at a happy or rewarding life..

This has not been my experience. My experience has been that my mistakes led to the best things in my life, and being embarrassed when you mess up is part of the human experience. Getting back up, dusting yourself off, and seeing who still wants to hang out after and laugh about it — that's a gift. The times I was told no, or wasn't included, wasn't chosen, didn't win, didn't make the cut, looking back, it really feels like those moments were as important, if not more crucial than the moments I was told yes..

Not being invited to the parties and sleepovers in my hometown made me feel hopelessly lonely, but because I felt alone I would sit in my room and write the songs that would get me a ticket somewhere else. Having label executives in Nashville tell me that only 35-year-old housewives listened to Country music and there was no place for a 13-year-old on their roster made me cry in the car on the way home. But then I'd post my songs on my MySpace — yes, MySpace — and I would message with other teens like me who loved country music, but just didn't have anyone singing from their perspective..

Having journalists write in-depth, oftentimes critical, pieces about who they perceived me to be made me feel like I was living in some weird simulation, but it also made me look inward to learn about who I actually am. Having the world treat my love life like a spectator sport in which I lose every single game was not a great way to date in my teens and twenties, but it taught me to protect my private life fiercely. Being publicly humiliated over and over again at a young age was excruciatingly painful, but it forced me to devalue the ridiculous notion of minute-by-minute, ever-fluctuating social relevance and likeability. Getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine..

I know I sound like a consummate optimist, but I'm really not. I lose perspective all the time. Sometimes, everything just feels completely pointless. I know the pressure of living your life through the lens of perfectionism. And I know that I'm talking to a group of perfectionists because you are here today graduating from NYU. So this might be hard for you to hear: In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, underreact, overreact, hurt the people who didn't deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom, finally address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat..

And I'm not going to lie, these mistakes will cause you to lose things. I'm trying to tell you that losing things doesn't just mean losing. A lot of the time, when we lose things, we gain things too. Now, you leave the structure and framework of school and chart your own path. Every choice you make leads to the next choice, which leads to the next, and I know it's hard to know which path to take. There will be times in life when you need to stand up for yourself. Times when the right thing is actually to back down and apologize. Times when the right thing is to fight. Times when the right thing is to turn and run. Times to hold on with all you have, and times to let go with grace. Sometimes the right thing to do is to throw out the old schools of thought in the name of progress and reform. Sometimes the right thing to do is to sit and listen to wisdom to those who have come before us. How will you know what the right choice is in these crucial moments? You won't. How do I give advice to this many people about their life choices? I won't. The scary news is, you're on your own now. But the cool news is, you're on your own now..

I leave you with this: We are led on our gut instincts, our intuition, our desires and fears, our scars, and our dreams. And you will screw it up sometimes. So will I, and when I do, you will most likely read about it on the internet. Anyway, hard things will happen to us, we will recover, we will learn from it, we will grow more resilient because of it, and as long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, and breathe out. And I am a doctor now, so I know how breathing works. I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. We're doing this together, so let's just keep dancing like we're the class of '22..

Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong,
But if you listen to just one thing I say.

You should turn Z93 on,

Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis,

Because she had the only phone for miles,
Now she uses it as a DJ,

Song title is : Drive (For Daddy Gene) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1415:
Verse 1:
It was painted red, the stripe was white,
It was 18 feet from bow to stern light,
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta,
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her,
We put on a shine, put on a motor,
Built out of love, and made for the water,
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten,
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten.

Chorus:
It was just an old plywood boat,
75 Johnson and an electric choke,
A young girl, two hands on the wheel,
I can't replace the way it made me feel,
And I would turn her sharp,
I would make it whine,
He'd say, You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides,
Just a little lake across the Alabama line,
But I was king of the ocean,
When Daddy let me drive.

Verse 2:
Just an old half ton short bed Ford,
My uncle bought new in '64,
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking,
A couple burnt valves and he had it going,
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load,
Down a dirt strip, we'd haul trash off of Thigpen Road,
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals,
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likeChorus:
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford,
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door,
A young girl, two hands on the wheel,
I can't replace the way it made me feel and,
I would press that clutch,
And I would keep it right,
He would say a little slower, girl,
You're doing just fine,
Just a dirt road with trash on each side,
But I was Mario Andretti,
When Daddy let me drive.

Bridge:
Soon I'll be grown up,
With daughters of my own,
I let them drive my old jeep,
Across the pasture at our home,
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file,
And pull out that old memory,
And think of me and smile,
And say.

Chorus:
It was just an old worn out jeep,
Rusty old floor boards,
Hot on my feet,
A young girl, two hands on the wheel,
I can't replace the way it made me feel,
And he'd say,
Steer it left, and turn it right,
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine,
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride,
But I was high on a mountain,
When Daddy let me drive,
Oh, he let me drive,
Oh, he let me drive,
Outro:
It's just an old plywood boat,
With a 75 johnson,
And electric chok.

Verse 1: Gary Lightbody:
Find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,

All roads they lead me here,
I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better.

And right before your eyes,
I’m breaking,
No fuss, no reasons why,
Just you and me,

Chorus: Both:
This is the last time I’m asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I’m asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye,

Verse 2: Taylor Swift:
You find yourself at my door,

But I was there to watch you leave,
And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better,

Intro: The Man:
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can,
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man,
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again,
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man,
I'd be the man, I'd be the man, yeah,
'Cause I'd be the man, I'd be the man.

Verse 1: Love Story:
We were both young when I first saw you,
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts,
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, Hello, little did I know.

Pre-Chorus 1: Love Story:
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, stay away from Juliet,
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, please don't go, and I said.

Chorus 1: Love Story:
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone,
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run,
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story baby, just say, 'Yes',

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago,
I was in your sights, you got me alone,

And when I fell hard, you took a step back,
Without me, without me, without me.

Pre-Chorus 2: I Knew You Were Trouble:
And he's long gone, when he's next to me,
And I realize the blame is on me.

I could show you incredible things,
Magic, madness, heaven, sin,
Saw you there, and I thought,
Oh my God, look at that face,

Love's a game, wanna play? Ayy,
New money, suit and tie,
I can read you like a magazine,
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly,
And I know you heard about me,
So hey, let's be friends,
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends,
Grab your passport and my hand,

So it's gonna be forever,
Or it's gonna go down in flames?,

Got a long list of ex-lovers,
They'll tell you I'm insane,
'Cause you know I love the players,
And you love the game,
'Cause we're young and we're reckless,
We'll take this way too far,
It'll leave you breathless, hmm,
Or with a nasty scar,
Got a long list of ex-lovers,
They'll tell you I'm insane,
But I've got a blank space, baby,
And I'll write your name.

This is our place, we make the rules,
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear,
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?.

Can we always be this close?,
Forever and ever, and,
Ah, take me out, take me home,
You're my, my, my, my lover.

Bridge 3: Lover:
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?,
With every guitar string scar on my hand,
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover,
My heart's been borrowed, yours has been blue,
All's well that ends well to end up with you,
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover,
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me,
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover.

Chorus 5: Lover:
Can I go where you go?,
Can we always be this close?,
Forever and ever, and,

Song title is : Back To December (European Version) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1424:
Verse 1:
I'm so glad you made time to see me,
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?,
I haven't seen them in a while,
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why,
Because the last time you saw me,
Is still burned in the back of your mind,
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

Chorus:
So this is me swallowin' my pride,
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you,
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine,
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright,
I go back to December all the time.

Verse 2:
These days, I haven't been sleepin',
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin',
When your birthday passed and I didn't call,
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side,
And realized I loved you in the fall,
And then the cold came, the dark days,
When fear crept into my mind,
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye,

I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind,

Bridge:
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry,
Maybe this is wishful thinkin',
Probably mindless dreamin',
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right,
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't,
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.

Chorus:
But this is me swallowin' my pride,
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night,

Feet in the swing over the creek,
I was too scared to jump in,
But I, I was high in the sky,
With Pennsylvania under me,
Are there still  beautiful  things?.

Chorus:
Sweet  tea in the  summer,
Cross your heart,  won't tell no other,
And though I can't recall your face,
I still got love for you,
Your braids make a pattern,
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn,
Passed down like folk songs,
The love lasts so long.

Verse 2:
And I've been meaning to tell you,
I think your house is haunted,
Your dad is always mad and that must be why,
And I think you should come live with me,
And we can be pirates,
Then you won't have to cry,
Or hide in the closet,
And just like a folk song,
Our love will be passed on,

And they called off the circus, burned the disco down,
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns,
I'm still on that tightrope,
I'm still tryin' everything to get you laughing at me,

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser,
Midnights become my afternoons,
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people,
I've ghosted stand there in the room.

Pre-Chorus:
I should not be left to my own devices,
They come with prices and vices,
I end up in crisis,

I wake up screaming from dreaming,

About why you switched your homeroom, but,
I think it's 'cause of me,
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard,
When I passed your house,
It's like I couldn't breathe.

Pre-Chorus:
You heard the rumors from Inez,
You can't believe a word she says,
Most times, but this time it was true,
The worst thing that I ever did,
Was what I did to you.

Chorus:
But if I just showed up at your party,
Would you have me? Would you want me?,
Would you tell me to go fuck myself,
Or lead me to the garden?,
In the garden, would you trust mе,
If I told you it was just a summer thing?,
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything,
But I know I miss you.

And people would say, They're the lucky ones,
I used to know my place was a spot next to you,
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
Lately, I don't even know what page you're on.

Pre-Chorus 1:
Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to fallout,
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up, I can't break through.

Chorus:
Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room,
And we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know,
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah,
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate,
When it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,

Verse 2:
How'd we end up this way?,
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
And you're doing your best to avoid me,
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us,
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
But you held your pride like you should've held me.

Pre-Chorus 2:
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing?,
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how,
I've never heard silence quite this loud.

Chorus:
Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room,
And we're not speaking,

Bridge:
This is looking like a contest,
Of who can act like they care less,
But I liked it better when you were on my side,
The battle's in your hands now,
But I would lay my armor down,
If you say you'd rather love than fight.

Pre-Chorus 3:
So many things that you wish I knew,
But the story of us might be ending soon.

Chorus:
Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room,

Song title is : All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Live on Saturday Night Live) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1431:
Verse 1:
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now.

Verse 2:
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze,
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate,
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

Pre-Chorus:
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh.

Chorus:
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street,
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me,
Wind in my hair, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

Verse 3:
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red,
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me,
And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy,
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town,
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, Any time now,
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was,
'Til we were dead and gone and buried,
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same,
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $165You might also likePre-Chorus:
And I know it's long gone and,
There was nothing else I could do,
And I forget about you long enough,
To forget why I needed to.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,
Down the stairs, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And there we are again when nobody had to know,
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath,
Sacred prayer and we'd swear,
To remember it all too well, yeah.

Bridge:
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up,
Runnin' scared, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest,
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here,
'Cause I remember it all, all, all,
Verse 4:
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell,
Every time you double-cross my mind,
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine,
And that made me want to die,
The idea you had of me, who was she?,
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you,
Not weepin' in a party bathroom,
Some actress askin' me what happened, you,
That's what happened, you,
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes,
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show,
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come,
And he said, It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one.

Verse 5:
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it,
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it,
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,
You can't get rid of it,
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah.

Chorus:
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, you were there,
You remember it all,
Down the stairs, you were there,
You remember it all,
It was rare, I was there,
I remember it all too well,
Verse 6:
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes,
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age,
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones,
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight,
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?,
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?,
'Cause in this city's barren cold,
I still remember the first fall of snow,
And how it glistened as it fell,
I remember it all too well.

Outro:
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?,
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?,
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there),
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it all too well,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh),
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there),
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it (All too well),
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it,
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there,
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there,
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there,
It was rare, you remember it.

the last great american dynasty (the long pond studio sessions) LyricsVerse 1:
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny,
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis,
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money,
And the town said, How did a middle-class divorcée do it?,
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche,
There's only so far new money goes,
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House,
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud,
The doctor had told him to settle down,
It must have been her fault his heart gave out.

Chorus:
And they said,
There goes the last great American dynasty,
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been,
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen,
She had a marvelous time ruining everything.

Verse 2:
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever,
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city,
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names,
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet,
And losing on card game bets with Dalí,

They say she was seen on occasion,
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea,
And in a feud with her neighbor,
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green,
Fifty years is a long time,
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach,
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits,
And then it was bought by me.

illicit affairs (the long pond studio sessions) LyricsVerse 1:
Make sure nobody sees you leave,
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down,
Tell your friends you're out for a run,
You'll be flushed when you return,
Take the road less traveled by,
Tell yourself  you  can  always stop,
What started  in beautiful rooms,
Ends  with meetings in parking lots.

Chorus:
And that's the thing about illicit affairs,
And clandestine meetings and longing stares,
It's born from just one single glance,
But it dies and it dies and it dies,
A million little times.

Verse 2:
Leave the perfume on the shеlf,
That you picked out just for him,
So you leave no tracе behind,
Like you don't even exist,
And take the words for what they are,
A dwindling, mercurial high,
A drug that only worked,
The first few hundred times,

Don't call me kid, don't call me baby,
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me,

Look at this idiotic fool that you made me,
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else.

And you know damn well,
For you, I would ruin myself,

I was a flight risk with a fear of falling,
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts.

Pre-Chorus:
I  say,  Can  you believe it?,
As  we're lyin' on  the couch,
The moment I could see it,
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Verse 2:

Green was the color of the grass,
Where I used to read at Centennial Park,
I used to think I would meet somebody there,
Teal was the color of your shirt,
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop,
You used to work at to make a little money.

Chorus:
Time, curious time,
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs,
Were there clues I didn't see?,
And isn't it just so pretty to think,
All along there was some,

Tying you to me?,

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab,
On your first trip to LA,
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner,

Bridge:
A string that pulled me,
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar,
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire,
Chains around my demons,
Wool to brave the seasons,
One single thread of gold,
Tied me to you.

Verse 3:
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind,
For the boys who broke my heart,
Now I send their babies presents,
Gold was the color of the leaves,
When I showed you around Centennial Park,
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven,

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies,
And it's cool,

Our coming-of-age has come and gone,
Suddenly this summer, it's clear,
I never had the courage of my convictions,
As long as danger is near,
And it's just around the corner, darlin',
'Cause it lives in me,
No, I could never give you peace.

Chorus:
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm,
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come,
All these people think love's for show,
But I would die for you in secret,
The devil's in the details, but you got a friеnd in me,
Would it be enough if I could nеver give you peace?.

Your integrity makes me seem small,
You paint dreamscapes on the wall,
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor,
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences,
Sit with you in the trenches,
Give you my wild, give you a child,
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other,
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother,
Is it enough?,
'Cause there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west,
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best,
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me,

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm,
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come,
All these people think love's for show,
And I would die for you in secret,
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me,
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?,
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?,
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?.

Drew looks at me,
I fake a smile so he won't see,

Everything that we should be.

That girl he talks about,
And she's got everything that I have to live without.

I laugh 'cause it's just so funny,
That I can't even see,
Anyone when he's with me.

Pre-Chorus:
He says he's so in love,
He's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.

Chorus:
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,
He's the song in the car I keep singing,

You and I walk a fragile line,
I have known it all this time,

Song title is : The Power of Pop by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1446:
-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear Cowboy Take Me Away by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear I Write Sins Not Tragedies by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear How to Save a Life by The Fray, Breathe (2AM) by Anna Nalick, or The Story by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that You Learn by Alanis Morissette, Put Your Records On by Corinne Bailey Rae and Why by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs..


I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever..

The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See Love Story, 2009).,
In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like Kiki, do you love me and Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana..

I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, this is what I went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time.

-ringing,
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing,
Be my mirror, my sword and shield,
My missionaries in a foreign field.

For some reason I can't explain,
Once you go there was never,
Never an honest word,
But that was when I ruled the world.

It was a wicked and wild wind,
Blew down the doors to let me in,
Shattered windows and the sound of drums,
People couldn't believe what I'd become,

It wasn’t just like a movie,
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes, down to my skin,

This is the last time I'll drive this way again,
There's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray,
Cause I, I still love you but I can’t.

Chorus:
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side,
Bye bye baby,
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing,
And all you have is to walk away,
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah.

Verse 2:
The picture frame is empty,
It’s black and white, you’re smiling down at me,
I take your photo off the dash,
And back to the conversation, we’re so sure of everything,
Everything we thought we’d always have,

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser,
Midnights become my afternoons,
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people,
I've ghosted stand there in the room.

Pre-Chorus:
I should not be left to my own devices,
They come with prices and vices,
I end up in crisis,
(Tale as old as time),
I wake up screaming from dreaming,
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving,
'Cause you got tired of my scheming,
(For the last time).

Pierced through the heart, but never killed.

Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?,

What do you sing on your drive home?,
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?,
Does she smile,
Or does she mouth Fuck you forever?.

Pre-Chorus:
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy,
What about that?,
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry.

Chorus:
And there's nothing like a mad woman,
What a shame she went mad,

And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out,

And there's nothing like a mad woman.

Has really brought you two together,

I don’t think you should wait, you speak now,
Drop everything now.

Verse 1:
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm,
And I'm a house of cards,
You're the kind of reckless,
That should send me running,
But I kinda  know  that  I won't get  far,
And you stood  there in front of me,
Just close enough to touch,
Close enough to hope you couldn't see,
What I was thinking of.

Chorus:
Drop everything now,
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Take away the pain,
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile,
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down,
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around,
I see sparks fly whenever you smile.

Verse 2:
My mind forgets to remind me,
You're a bad idea,
You touch me once and it's really something,

Should have been different but,
It wasn't different, was it,
Same old story, dear john,

Like a diamond ring,
A token of true love,
Should have all worked out,
But it didn't,
She should be here now,
But she isn't.

Chorus:
There's your trouble,
There's your trouble,
You keep seeing double,
With the wrong one,
You can't see I love you,
You can't see she doesn't,
But you just keep holding on,
There's your trouble.

Verse 2:
So now you're thinking 'bout,
All you're missing how,
Deep you're sinking,
Round and round and dragging down,
Why don't you cash in your chips,
Why don't you call it a loss,
Not such a big loss,
Chalk it up better luck,
Could have been true love,
But it wasn't,
It should all add up,
But it doesn't,

Song title is : Bejeweled (Behind The Song) by Taylor Swift:
 The song Bejeweled,
These are the song lyrics for song #1459:
Spoken:
The song Bejeweled is a song that I think is really about finding confidence when you feel that it's been taken away, for whatever reason. You know, you're feeling insecure, you're feeling taken for granted. One of the things we love to do at night is we love to go dancing, we love to put on an outfit that makes us feel good, and we love to feel like we're still bejeweled. And I think that there are tiny inflections of me, hyping myself up to return to pop music after spending these glorious years writing folk songs and being in this metaphorical forest that I've created. Which I've loved so much but there, there was like a bit of pumping myself back up to be like, You can do it, you're still bejeweled, like, I'm still bejeweled, question mark? Um, we'll see, but that's what the song's about.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

-Hero (Behind The Song) LyricsSpoken:
The story of Anti-Hero is that it really encapsulates this album and sort of the darkest corners of your mind when you can't sleep. Playing out a dismal version of your very dark future, um, being afraid of what everyone thinks about you. Really exploring your own self-loathing and kind of having a shocking, scary self-awareness about your flaws as a human being, you know? Anxiety, it's, uh, it's all throughout this song.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

Song title is : Karma (Behind The Song) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1465:
Spoken:
So, one of the themes about Midnights is how you're feeling in the middle of the night, and that can be intense self-hatred, intense self-love; you go through these very polarizing emotions when you're up late at night and your brain just spirals. It can spiral downward and it can spiral way up, and you can be really feeling yourself, and Karma is written from a perspective of feeling really happy, really proud of the way your life is, feeling like this must be a reward for going stuff right. It's a song that I really love because I think wе all need some of those moments, you know, wе can't just be beating ourselves up all the time. You have to have these moments where you're like, You know what? Karma is my boyfriend, and that's it.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

Song title is : 2021 BRIT Global Icon Award Speech by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1468:
- I wanna grab you, I can't we're social distancing, but thank you so much for coming here to do this - and that video, anyone that was in that video, Selena, Zoe, Ed, Griff! And, my soul left my body when Annie Lennox was on that video, that was like a thousand surprise birthday parties where all your friends are jumping out like ahh! and you're just like this is the best!.

I wanna thank the BRITs, or anyone who decided that I would be worthy of this incredible honor. I'm really really proud to be a part of this musical community, especially in a year where we all needed music so much, but what we needed even more was the help and support we got from the NHS and the key workers who are here tonight. Thank you for everything that you've done for us..

This is a really cool one, I love this! I am so indebted to and grateful for my British fans, I love you so much for everything you've done for me. We've had so many amazing memories inn the last 15 years, from playing Shepherd's Bush Empire, to playing the O2 Arena, to playing Wembley Stadium, and hey, because of you, last year I almost played Glastonbury so. But, we all know what happened next, the world changed and I ended up putting out three albums instead..

Making folklore and evermore was one of the most unique, cathartic, extraordinary experiences I've ever had. I would love the opportunity to thank the amazing creative people that I made those albums with. Thank you Aaron Dessner, thank you Jack Antonoff, Joe, Justin Vernon, The National, Marcus Mumford, Jon Low, Serban Ghenea, Laura Sisk, and HAIM. I wanna thank my friends and family, who know exactly who they are, whose opinion of me never changed whether my stock was up or down, if there's one thing that I've learned it's that you have to look around you everyday and take note of the people who have always believed in you, and never stop appreciating them for it, never take them for granted..

There are so many incredible new artists in this room tonight, and a lot of people watching who have goals and ambitions and dreams for themselves. I need you to hear me when I say there is no career path that comes free of negativity. If you're being met with resistance, that probably means that you're doing something new. If you're experiencing turbulence or pressure, that probably means you're rising. And there might be times when you put your whole heart and soul into something and it is met with cynicism or skepticism. You cannot let that crush you, you have to let it fuel you, because we live in a world where anyone has the right to say anything that they want about you at anytime. But just please remember that you have the right to prove them wrong..

I love you all thank you so much for this beautiful honor, thank you to the BRITs! This is amazing.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

I've ghosted stand there in the room.

One day, I'll watch as you're leaving,

Song title is : Mastermind (Behind The Song) by Taylor Swift:
 Mastermind,
These are the song lyrics for song #1474:
Spoken:
Mastermind is a song that I put last on the album because I'm really proud of it, and I love that, when we were making this song, we wanted the verse to sound like romance and this sort of heroes type of soundtrack, and then we wanted the chorus to sound like a villain has just entered the room and the idea that you're flipping this narrative, and you have been planning and plotting things and making them look like an accident — and I think that's sort of an inside joke between me and my fans, that I tend to do that. And so, this song is thе romantic version of that.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

Song title is : Forever Winter (Demo) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1475:
Verse 1:
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days,
He says, Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?,
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be,
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity.

Pre-Chorus:
I call, just checking up on him,
He's up, 3AM, pacing,
He says, It's not just a phase I'm in,
My voice comes out begging.

Chorus:
All this time, I didn't know,
You were breaking down,
I'd fall to pieces on the floor,
If you weren't around,
Too young to know it gets better,
I'll be summer sun for you forevеr,
Forever winter if you go, oh-oh,
Woah-oh-oh.

Verse 2:
Hе seems fine most of the time,
Forcing smiles and never minds,
His laugh is a symphony,
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe,
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head,
Live my life scared to death, he'll decide to leave instead,

Verse 1:
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables,
Left a small town and never looked back,
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling,
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts.

Pre-Chorus 1:
I say, Can  you  believe  it?,
As we're lying  on the couch,
The  moment, I could see it,
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Chorus:
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?,
You put your arm around me for the first time,
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Verse 2:
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together,
And there's a drawer of my things at your place,
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.

Pre-Chorus 2:
But we got bills to pay,
We got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes,
This is what I thought about:

As everything was slipping right out of our hands,

Braced myself for the goodbye,

Then, you took me by surprise,
You said, I'll never leave you alone..

Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs,

The jury's out, but my choice is you.

Song title is : Evermore Foreword:  by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1485:
Foreword:  LyricsTo put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. I’ve never done this before. In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

Song title is : “Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈” by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1487:
🗳😃🌈” LyricsI’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent..

I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway..

So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info.

Verse 1:
We were both young when I first saw you,
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts,
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way  through  the  crowd,
And say, Hello,
Little  did I know.

Pre-Chorus:
That  you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet,
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, Please, don't go, and I said.

Chorus:
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone,
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run,
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say Yes.

These are the song lyrics for song #1492:
Spoken Intro:
This is the song that got it all started for me,
It's called Tim McGraw.

Verse 1:
He said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,
I said, That's a lie,
Just a boy in a Chevy truck,
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,
On backroads at night,
And I was right there beside him all summer long,
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone.

Chorus:
But when you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song,
The one we danced to all night long,
The moon like a spotlight on the lake,
When you think happiness,
I hope you think that little black dress,
Think of my head on your chest,
And my old faded blue jeans,
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me,

September saw a month of tears,
And thankin' God that you weren't here,
To see me like that,
But in a box beneath my bed,
Is a letter that you never read,
From three summers back,
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet,
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe.

Chorus:
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song,

Bridge:
And I'm back for the first time since then,
I'm standin' on your street,
And there's a letter left on your doorstep,
And the first thing that you'll read is:
Is when you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song,
Someday you'll turn your radio on,
I hope it takes you back to that place,
Chorus:

One, two.

Verse 1:
Well, I was riding shotgun with my hair undone,
In the front seat of his car,
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart,
I look around, turn the radio down,
He says, Baby, is something wrong?,
I say, Nothing, I was just thinking,
How we don't have a song,
And he says.

Chorus:
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window,
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,
Our song is the way you laugh,
The first date: Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have,
And when I got home 'fore I said amen,
Asking God if he could play it again.

Verse 2:
I was walking up the front porch steps,
After everything that day,
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on,
And lost and thrown away,
Got to the hallway, well on my way,
To my lovin' bed,
I almost didn't notice all the roses,
And the note that said,

And I said: Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone,
I keep waiting for you but you never come,
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring,
And said, said, said, said.

Chorus 1:
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone,
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run,
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story baby just say yes.

Outro:
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel,
This love is difficult, but it's real,
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess,
It's a love story baby just say yes.

These are the song lyrics for song #1505:
Verse 1:
There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained,
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car,
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there,
In the middle  of  the  parking lot, yeah,
Oh,  yeah.

We're driving down  the road, I wonder if you know,
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now,
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair,
Absentmindedly making me want you.

Chorus:
And I don't know how it gets better than this,
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless,
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance,
In a storm in my best dress, fearless.

Verse 2:
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town,
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat,
You put your eyes on me,
In this moment now, capture it, remember it.

Chorus:
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this,
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless,
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance,

He says, Baby, is something wrong?,
I say, Nothin', I was just thinkin',
How we don't have a song,
And he says.

Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window,
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,

And when I got home, 'fore I said amen,

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser,
Midnights become my afternoons,
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people,
I've ghosted stand there in the room.

Pre-Chorus:
I should not be left to my own devices,
They come with prices and vices,
I end up in crisis,
(Tale as old as time),
I wake up screaming from dreaming,
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving,
'Cause you got tired of my scheming,

And I'm a monster on the hill,

Or you could begin at the beginning,
And in that case.

Feet in the swing over the creek,
I was too scared to jump in,
But I was high in the sky,
Pennsylvania under me,
Are there still beautiful things?.

Sweet tea in the summer,
Cross your heart, won't tell no other,
And though I can't recall your face,
I still got love for you,
Your braids make a pattern,
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn,
Passed down like folk songs,

But your heart nowhere to be found,

But you can’t bandage a bullet wound.

You’re next to me by my side,

You fall in love madly,
The crying into kissing,
The loving into fighting,
The hurting into feelings,
Then you feel like the fool, you let him in again ‘cause of the good days, good dates, good nights,
You start to only remember the good parts,
Not the screaming, fighting, crying and your soul dying,
He sold you a fantasy, my bedroom walls tells a different story,
Then he says no more,
But they still put out their hand,
And say let’s go.

Song title is : Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1517:
-looking man wearing a black tuxedo. The video seems to be of a televised award show. The tape is grainy, but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear:.

Now I'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brenda's metal in this song I wish I'd wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee..

The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and she's looking down at a framed picture. She's at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. That's when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is Someone Loves You Honey. The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee..

Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her..

I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. There's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, it's almost like she's golden.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

Song title is : NMPA Songwriter Icon Award Speech by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1518:
е opportunity to learn and to nurture that craft, and I want to take a momеnt to thank the people who were my professors, my teachers, of the craft of songwriting..

First of all, to anyone who wrote with me in Nashville when I was in eighth or ninth grade: That is insane that you did that, and I am so lucky that I got to learn from some of the best writers on Music Row. Liz Rose was someone who spent hours and hours and hours with me when there was absolutely no sign that anything would happen in my career. My dance card was not full, I was 14, and she wrote with me so many times and taught me how to edit my ideas down into something that would pack an emotional punch..

Then, later in my career, I got to work with Max Martin and Johan Shellback, who I learned so much from in:  a melodic sense, and I will carry those lessons with me for the rest of my life. I will learn more lessons from them next time we work together, and I feel really lucky that they’ve been a part of my life.,
Jack Antonoff is such a wonderful creator and such a nurturing presence — with his own art and other artists, he’s just so versatile and such a wonderful friend. Aaron Dessner came into my life recently, and he is just such a prolific creator. All of these people changed my writing and helped shape it..

There are so many others, though. So if you’ve ever sat in a room and cowritten with me, thank you so much. Anyone who’s ever wanted to produce one of my songs, any collaborator I’ve ever had — I’ve learned from all of you. I want to say thank you to Troy Tomlinson for always being excited to hear new songs of mine, and to Jody Gerson for being such a champion of female songwriters throughout the industry..

This is something I am so proud to receive. And to the fans who are out there who care about my lyrics — you have no idea how much it means to me that you dissect them and copy them into your journals and care about the words that I write..

There are amazing songwriters who came before me who deserve this, there are incredible songwriters coming up now who are so impressive and amazing: I have such an affinity and respect for all of you. I am honored to receive this. Thank you so much.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $.

You know, I haven't seen you around before.

The 1950s shit they want from me,
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze.

Verse 2:
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me),
Is if I'm gonna be your bride,
Thе only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see),
Is a one-night or a wifе,

Song title is : Should’ve Said No (International Mix) by Taylor Swift:
These are the song lyrics for song #1521:
Verse 1:
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing,
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone,
Yesterday I found out about you,
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong.

Pre-Chorus:
You say that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance,
It was a moment of weakness,
And you said yes.

Chorus:
You should've said no, you should've gone home,
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go,
You should've known that word,
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me),
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind,
I shouldn't be asking myself why,
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet,
You should've said no,
Baby, and you might still have me.

Verse 2:
You can see that I've been cryin',
And baby, you know all the right things to say,
But do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?,

Song title is : Bejeweled (Mixed) Jan 2023:  by Taylor Swift:
[Verse 1:
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind,
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind,
In the shoes I gave you as a present,
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five,
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight.

Chorus:
Best believe I'm still bejeweled,
When I walk in the room,
I can still make the whole place shimmer,
And when I meet the band,
They ask, Do you have a man?,
I could still say, I don't remember,
Familiarity breeds contempt,
Don't put me in the basement,
When I want the penthouse of your heart,
Diamonds in my eyes,
I polish up real, I polish up real nice.

Post-Chorus:
Nice.

Verse:
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl),
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve,
I think it's time to teach some lessons,
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh),
I can reclaim the land,
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice),

These are the song lyrics for song #1525:
-Hero (Mixed) LyricsVerse 1:
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser,
Midnights become my afternoons,
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people,
I've ghosted stand there in the room.

Pre-Chorus:
I should not be left to my own devices,
They come with prices and vices,
I end up in crisis,
(Tale as old as time),
I wake up screaming from dreaming,
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving,
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming,
(For the last time).

Chorus:
It's mе, hi,
I'm the problem, it's me,
At teatime, everybody agrees,
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror,
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero.

Verse 2:
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby,
And I'm a monster on the hill,
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city,
Pierced through the heart, but never killed,

(For the last time).

Chorus:

Bridge:
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money,
She thinks I left them in the will,
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out,
She's laughing up at us from Hell.

Drew looks at me,
I fake a smile so he won't see,
That I want and I'm needing,
Everything that we should be.

Anyone when he's with me.

He's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,
He's the song in the car I keep singing,

As I turn off the light,
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight.

 1 ContributorWhispered Promises Lyrics[Verse 1:
These are the song lyrics for song #1527:
Verse 1: Taylor Swift:
We danced in the shadows, lost in the night,
Wrapped in your embrace, everything felt right,
But time had its secrets, it slowly unveiled,
The cracks in our foundation, the love that had paled.

Verse 2: Dua Lipa:
Your promises whispered, I believed every word,
Blinded by passion, my judgment obscured,
But hindsight is cruel, it reveals the disguise,
And now we're left with echoes, haunting our cries.

Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Dua Lipa:
Oh, the lovе we thought we found, it slipped away somеhow,
Leaving us with echoes of regret, screaming so loud,
We played a dangerous game, lost in a masquerade,
Now we're left to face the echoes that won't fade.

Chorus: Taylor Swift & Dua Lipa:
Echoes of regret, haunting every breath,
Our love became a battlefield, a dance with certain death,
But we'll find our strength, rise above the pain,
Though this duet remains unsung, the echoes still remain.

Bridge: Taylor Swift & Dua Lipa:
We built our castle on a crumbling ground,
The pieces fell apart, crashing down all around,
But through the wreckage, we'll emerge stronger than before,
And in the echoes of regret, we'll find the strength to restore,

For they remind us of a love that once truly car.

These are the song lyrics for song #1528:
е was a party to be thrown,
But that was a million years ago.

When I walk around all of thе streets,
Where I grew up and found my feet,
They can't look me in the eye,
It's like they're scared of me,
I try to think of things to say,
Like a joke or a memory,
But they don't recognize me now,
In the light of day,

I feel like my life is flashing by,
And all I can do is watch and cry,
I miss the air, I miss my friends,
I miss my mother, I miss it when,
Life was a party to be thrown,
But that was a million years ago,
